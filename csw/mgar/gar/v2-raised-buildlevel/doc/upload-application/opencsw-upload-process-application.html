<h1>OpenCSW Upload Application</h1>
<p>This application is used to upload packages to be distributed by
OpenCSW. The application is supposed to be used by both humans doing
uploads manually and by tools. HTML is used as the main hypermedia to
communicate interactions.</p>
<p>
An informal summary of the process:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A new upload is created. The upload is a long-lived resource so
it will get its own URI.<br>
  </li>
  <li>A set of files with metadata is attached to the upload.</li>
  <li>If wanted the maintainer can run the checkpkg tool to find any
issues with the packages to be uploaded.</li>
  <li>The upload is frozen and sent to the release manager for approval.</li>
</ul>
<img style="width: 688px; height: 450px;"
 alt="Image showing the flow between the pages and the forms used on the interactions"
 src="upload-process.png"><br>
<h2>General Constraints</h2>
It is expected that any user agent:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Includes any hidden elements in a form. Only inputs that the user
agent is expected to fill out are documented.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Uses the method specified in a form.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h1>Pages</h1>
<h2>Catalog Release Summary</h2>
A document listing all packages and the architecture/release
combination they support. Should include a <a
 href="#create_upload_form">"Create Upload" form</a>. It should be
possible to use content negotiation get the data as an Atom feed.<br>
<h2>Upload Summary</h2>
<p>A document that shows the current state of the upload. It should
include the <a href="#add_file_form">"Add File"</a>, <a
 href="#checkpkg_report_form">"checkpkg report"</a>, <a
 href="#delete_upload_form">"delete upload"</a>, <a
 href="#submit_upload_Form">"submit upload"</a> forms.</p>
<p>There must be a <span style="font-family: monospace;">span</span>
element with the id <span style="font-family: monospace;">upload-state</span>.
Currently available upload states:</p>
<ul>
  <li style="font-family: monospace;">unsubmitted</li>
  <li><span style="font-family: monospace;">submitted</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The user agent should not use the value for anything in particular
but instead look at the available forms when presenting options to the
user. The field is there as information for humans.<br>
</p>
<h2>Checkpkg Report</h2>
<p>An informal report showing any errors/warnings detected from the
checkpkg tool.<br>
</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">TODO: The format of the checkpkg report
might be formalized in its own media type later on but right now that
doesn't exist.</p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">TODO: It would be nice to be able
to select the format of this report. For tools it would be useful with
a plain text version that they can show to the user directly. As it is
now there's no need for any links from this page so the media doesn't
need a way to represent links.</span></p>
