This directory contains Python libraries, mostly related to checkpkg.

==Checkpkg==

Checks to implement:
 - *dev(el)? -> error, suggest *-dev
 - *-?rt -> error, suggest specific library packages
 - empty package without 'transitional' in the name --> error, suggest
   'transitional'
 - CSWpmfoo --> error, suggest CSWpm-foo
 - Dependency on a transitional package --> error
   ('transitional', 'stub', 'legacy')
 - Dependency on CSWcas-initsmf + rc* files --> error
 - A package must not be incompatible with itself
 - If a pkgmap entry has username or group outside the default list of users,
   the file's class needs to be 'ugfiles'
 - If there is bin/*-config and there is lib/(sparcv9|amd64)/.*, there must
   also be bin/(sparcv9|amd64)/*(-|_)config
 - Binaries from /opt/csw/bin and/or sbin should not have the same names
   as any binaries from /usr/bin and/or sbin.

Checks implemented:
 - foo_bar != CSWfoo-bar -> error
 - outside /opt/csw, /etc/opt/csw, /var/opt/csw -> error

Development plan for checkpkg:
  Primary focus:
  - Add support for tiering (core/active/unsupported)
  - Remeber, against which catalogs has a package been checked, and
    when.
  - Add MySQL database garbage collection
    - Currently, the database is growing indefinitely, at the time of writing
      it's 1.5GB uncompressed.
  - When adding a package to a catalog, store the time and date of the
    addition
    - Can be generalized as logging
  - Add fields to the srv4_file_stats table:
    - source URL (for grouping by software)
    - Description (to search for the word 'transitional')
    - Whether the package is obsolete
  - Don't suggest two packages for the same soname.
  Additional, nice to have:
  - Allow maintainers to opt-out from notifications
  - Display stats from each run
  - Shorten the on-screen output, add commands to display override lines
  - Move the set check stats outside of checking functions, remove the special
    status of dependency checking functions; add a progress bar for it.
  - Sort all list data structures so that it's possible to diff the results of
    pprint.pprint() and see meaningful results.  This will be the new
  - Restructure the error reporting, group them by errors.
    implementation for comparepkg.

Also, see ticket list on trac: http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/gar/report/1

Items done:
- Move the 'data' field of the srv4_file table to a separate table (should
  speed up checking if stats are already collected)
- Store run history
- Generalize dependency checking by adding NeedFile(file_list, reason) to
  error_mgr.  It's possible to need one of the listed files only, so files are
  given as alternatives, but the reason is common.
- Notify maintainers when their package is available from mirrors
- Add support for the 'overridden' field in the database
- Support for relocatable packages

Known problems:
- libmagic fails sometimes when processing the whole catalog
- hachoir_parser fails sometimes on i386 packages when examining them on sparc

Package dependencies:

It's possible to develop checkpkg on a non-Solaris platform, using unit
tests as means to run various bits of code.  Here's the dependency list
for Ubuntu.

sudo aptitude install \
  python-mysql \
  python-cheetah \
  python-hachoir-parser \
  python-magic \
  python-mox \
  python-progressbar \
  python-pycurl \
  python-sqlobject \
  python-unittest2 \
  python-yaml

Solaris package dependencies.

===Checkpkg database===

Additional database indexes:

# TODO(maciej): Add them to the models.py

CREATE INDEX srv4_mtime_idx ON srv4_file_stats(mtime);
CREATE INDEX srv4_md5_idx ON srv4_file_stats(md5_sum);
CREATE INDEX catalog_idx ON srv4_file_in_catalog (arch_id, osrel_id, catrel_id);
