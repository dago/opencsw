This directory contains Python libraries, mostly related to checkpkg.

==Checkpkg==

Development plan for checkpkg:
- Generalize dependency checking by adding NeedFile(file_list, reason) to
  error_mgr.  It's possible to need one of the listed files only, so files are
  given as alternatives, but the reason is common.
- Display stats from each run
- Shorten the on-screen output, add commands to display override lines
- Move the set check stats outside of checking functions, remove the special
  status of dependency checking functions; add a progress bar for it.
- Restructure the error reporting, group them by errors.
- Sort all list data structures so that it's possible to diff the results of
  pprint.pprint() and see meaningful results.  This will be the new
  implementation for comparepkg.

Also, see ticket list on trac: http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/gar/report/1

Items done:
- Move the 'data' field of the srv4_file table to a separate table (should
  speed up checking if stats are already collected)
- Store run history

Known problems:
- libmagic fails sometimes when processing the whole catalog
- hachoir_parser fails sometimes on i386 packages when examining them on sparc

Package dependencies:

It's possible to develop checkpkg on a non-Solaris platform, using unit
tests as means to run various bits of code.  Here's the dependency list
for Ubuntu.

sudo aptitude install \
  python-cheetah \
  python-hachoir-parser \
  python-magic \
  python-mox \
  python-progressbar \
  python-sqlobject \
  python-yaml
