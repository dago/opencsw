Python libraries, mostly related to checkpkg.

Development plan for checkpkg:

- Move the 'data' field of the srv4_file table to a separate table (should
	speed up checking if stats are already collected)
- Store run history and display stats from each run
- Shorten the on-screen output, add commands to display override lines
- Move the set check stats outside of checking functions, remove the special
	status of dependency checking functions; add a progress bar for it.
- Restructure the error reporting, group them by errors.


Known problems:
- libmagic fails sometimes when processing the whole catalog


Dependencies:

It's possible to develop checkpkg on a non-Solaris platform, using unit
tests as means to run various bits of code.  Here's the dependency list
for Ubuntu.

sudo aptitude install \
