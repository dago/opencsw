Python libraries, mostly related to checkpkg.

Development plan for checkpkg:

- Move the 'data' field of the srv4_file table to a separate table (should
	speed up checking if stats are already collected)
- Store run history and display stats from each run
- Shorten the on-screen output, add commands to display override lines
- Move the set check stats outside of checking functions, remove the special status of dependency checking functions
- Restructure the error reporting, group them by errors.
