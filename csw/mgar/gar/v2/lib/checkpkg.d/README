This directory contains modular checks.  Each check is an executable file,
written in any language, accepting specific command line options and returning
the result by writing to a text file.

To see the required flags, issue:

./checkpkg-you-can-write-your-own.py -h

Each test's file name must begin with "checkpkg-".

See http://wiki.opencsw.org/checkpkg for more information.
