# A quick hack of a script to find files that are not added to any
# package The idea is that we build a list of files from the main
# prototype file in build-global.  Then, we look for each arch
# specific prototype and remove files that we see there from the
# global list.  Any remaining file is not listed in a package
# prototype and therefore won't be delivered to client systems.

# We expect a path to build-global as an argument.  No error checking
# is done on this.

    # store references to each file.  remove these while traversing
    # sub-package prototypes
