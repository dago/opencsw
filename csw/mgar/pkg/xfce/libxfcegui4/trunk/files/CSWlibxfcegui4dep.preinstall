# OpenCSW.org Xfce libxfcegui4 preinstall script
#
# The purpose of this script is to remove from file installation database the list of files
# which previoulsy belongued to xfce_panel and have been moved to this package.
# the removal of these files during preinstallation is needed to prevent conflicts to happen
# since xfce_panel depends on this package and will be updated after this package
#
