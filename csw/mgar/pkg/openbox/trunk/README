This compile  is a bit odd.
It is "intelligent" and adds -I/usr/openwin/include, but that actually
breaks us.
make sure to REMOVE it.

it also "helpfully" adds a buncha junk such as -L /usr/openwin/lib.
kill it


Note that this package will benefit by having "obconf", and
"openbox_themes" installed as well



This thing passes in defines on the COMMAND LINE  (-Dxxx) 
instead of having a civilized config.h file



the "ShapeInput" ifdefs, are inspired by sawfish ifdefs that I saw.
