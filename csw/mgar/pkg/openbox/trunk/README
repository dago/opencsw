Random notes for compilation and patching...

This compile  is a bit odd.
It is "intelligent" and adds -I/usr/openwin/include, but that actually
breaks us. make sure to REMOVE it.
 Turns out we can deal with it by setting X_CFLAGS on config line.

Note that this package will benefit by having "obconf", and
"openbox_themes" installed as well

This thing passes in defines on the COMMAND LINE  (-Dxxx) 
instead of having a civilized config.h file


The "ShapeInput" ifdefs, are inspired by sawfish ifdefs that I saw.
