There are now two versions of mutt on the system installed:

  * mutt-ncurses  with ncurses interface
  * mutt-slang    with slang interface (per default linked to 'mutt')

You can easily select between the versions with the alternatives(8)
system by executing

  /opt/csw/sbin/alternatives --config mutt

See http://www.opencsw.org/packages/alternatives for details.
