VERSION = 0.1.7
CATEGORIES = lib

DESCRIPTION = Secret Rabbit Code (aka libsamplerate) is a Sample Rate Converter for audio
define BLURB
  SRC is capable of arbitrary and time varying conversions ; from
  downsampling by a factor of 256 to upsampling by the same factor.
  Arbitrary in this case means that the ratio of input and output sample
  rates can be an irrational number. The conversion ratio can also vary
  with time for speeding up and slowing down effects.
