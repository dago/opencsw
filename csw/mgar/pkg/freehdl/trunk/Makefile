# TODO: Consider adding this patch: http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=549484

NAME = freehdl
VERSION = 0.0.7
CATEGORIES = devel

DESCRIPTION = A free, open source, GPL'ed VHDL simulator
define BLURB
To develop a VHDL simulator that:
 o Has a graphical waveform viewer.
 o Has a source level debugger.
 o Is VHDL-93 compliant.
 o Is of commercial quality. (on par with, say, V-System - it'll take us a while to get there, but that should be our aim)
 o Is freely distributable - both source and binaries - like Linux itself. (Under the Gnu General Public License (GPL)).
