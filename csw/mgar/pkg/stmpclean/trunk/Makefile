DESCRIPTION = Removes old files from the specified directory
define BLURB
  The stmpclean utility never removes files or directories owned by root.
  It is a feature, not a bug. Great care is taken while descending into
  the directory, and the operation is secure. Unlike floating around Perl
  scripts that do the same task stmpclean never forks and consumes limited
  amount of memory (these Perl script easily turn into forking bombs when
  someone creates a lot a directories under /tmp). If your system is
  attacked and the attacker creates an extremely deep file hierarchy,
  stmpclean won't add to the problem by crashing your system trying to
  remove it.
