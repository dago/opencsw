# If you want to keep spool directories around if the filter fails,

# If "yes", turn on the multiplexor relay checking function

# Set to yes if you want the multiplexor to log events to syslog

# Number of slaves reserved for connections from loopback.  Use -1

# The multiplexor does not start all slaves at the same time.  Instead,
# it starts one slave every MX_SLAVE_DELAY seconds when the system is idle.
# (If the system is busy, the multiplexor starts slaves as incoming mail
# requires attention.)
# MX_SLAVE_DELAY=3

# The next setting is an absolute limit on slave activation.  The multiplexor
# will NEVER activate a slave within MX_MIN_SLAVE_DELAY seconds of another.
# The default of zero means that the multiplexor will activate slaves as
# quickly as necessary to keep up with incoming mail.
# MX_MIN_SLAVE_DELAY=0

# Set to yes if you want the multiplexor to log stats in

# Maximum number of processes to run (mail received while this many
# processes are running is rejected with a temporary failure, so be

# I question why I'm including this as I see no real need for it
# but in the interests of a flexible implementation, here goes!
#
# DO NOT CHANGE THIS VARIABLE LIGHTLY!!
#
# The filtering program used by mimedefang or the multiplexor. This is
# *NOT* a replacement for /etc/mail/mimedefang-filter!!!  It replaces
# the entire mimedefang perl program, /usr/bin/mimedefang.pl and allows
# a unique filtering agent to be used.  Read mimedefang-protocol man
# page VERY carefully before you attempt to change this!

# FILTER=/usr/bin/mimedefang.pl
