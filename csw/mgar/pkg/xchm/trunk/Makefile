define BLURB
  xCHM is a cross-platform GUI front-end to chmlib, with borrowed bits from Pabs' chmdeco project.
  xCHM can show the content tree if one is available, print pages, change font face and size,
  remember bookmarks, display a searchable index, and search for words in the current page and the whole book.
