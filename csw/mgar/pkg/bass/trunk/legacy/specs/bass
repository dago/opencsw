Preamble:
  Basically, give this game away, share it with your friends. Don't remove this
Readme, or pretend you wrote it. You can include it in a software collection,
like a linux distribution or coverdisk (which may be sold), but using it in
things like commercial adventure game collections without asking is just playing
dirty. This preamble is not legally binding, but is to clarify the intent of the
following license.

it in aggregate as part of a larger & possibly commercial software distribution
(such as a Linux distribution or magazine coverdisk). You must provide proper
attribution and ensure this readme and all associated copyright notices, and
disclaimers are left intact.

 3) You may not charge a fee for the game itself. This includes reselling the
game as an individual item.
