This is a README for the "createpkg" style templates in the
OpenCSW subversion tree. 
The purpose of the templates, is to offer a build system in our
subversion tree, that is more simply based on plain Makefiles, than 
gar. (which effectively has its own language!)

At the same time, this style aims to be compliant with the high level
standard build API. 
We used to have a generically written one, but at the moment I only see,
http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/gar/wiki/GAR%20Build%20Targets%20Reference

Initial Setup
--------------------

First, get an initial checkout of the subversion tree. it is fine
to have a partial checkout, such as


svn co -N https://gar.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/gar/csw/mgar/pkg
cd pkg
svn co https://gar.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/gar/csw/mgar/pkg/TEMPLATES

You can then automatically create a new directory tree for new software, with

  "make  createpkg-softwarenamehere"

this will create [pkg]/softwarenamehere/trunk, copy in some templated
useful files, and set it up to be ready for svn checkin.

Dont worry, this does not actually attempt to create anything in the public 
tree. it will only do that, if you did an svn commit

[ if you want to do things manually, or you only have this EMPLATES directory,
  see ./copy_templates or ./generate_branch ]

Customise the template files
-----------------------------

cd into [yoursoftware/trunk] 
You should edit (or remove) the files present as you deem 
apropriate. In particular, copy the specific Makefile.xxx to Makefile, and
remove the others if you wish. Then,  

  svn add   filename(s)

the ones you want to keep in the repository.
The makefiles are current a work in progress. The most fully developed
at the moment is "Makefile.lib32"


If you are doing a general-case binary build package, then you will next need
to do the following:

1. Set up your environment variables as appropriate, and/or
  set the appropriate variables in Makefile

(2) Make extra sure the URLs, etc in the Makefile are set to
   properly download the appropriate source file. if you alread have a copy,
   make sure it is in the local src cache (by default, /home/src)


3. gmake
   This should automatically do a "gmake fetch",
   "gmake extract" (which creates a build subdir), and then
   a general make for the softwar.

You also have a choice of some optional subtargets, such as
  make  {configure,build,package,clean,reallyclean}. See "Make Targets"
  lower down for more details.

If you wish a patch set to be applied to the source before configure, create
a file called "patchfile.preconf" and put them there.

If you wish a patch set to be applied to the source AFTER configure, but
before compiling (for example, to hand-hack config.h) create a file called
"patchfile.postconf"


DONT FORGET to update all fields in the pkginfo file, and also to create
appropriate copyright, depend and prototype files.
Note that there is a make target that explicitly tries to generate one
for you: pkgproto




Make Targets
--------------------

Currently supported makefile targets by the full-length makefiles, are:

 * extract
 * sparc-32 sparc64 i386-32 i386-64
 * configure-(ARCH)-(32/64)
 * build-(ARCH)-(32/64)
 * stage-(ARCH)-(32/64)
 * clean
 * distclean
 * reallyclean
 * package
 * pkgproto

Note that there is a single shared upstream source archive, that should be
extracted under a "build" directory.
The "clean" and "distclean" targets, are only pass-through targets, that
will call the upstream source tree makefile with that argument.


There are also assorted internal makefile targets which probably wont interest
you. What MAY interest you, are the timestamp markers, described below.

Make Timestamps
--------------------

Each major makefile target, has a "done" file marker. They are kept in
dotfiles under the "build" directory.
For example, the target "configure-sparc-32", will create a file,
  build/.configure-sparc-32.done
when successfully completed.

If you wish to force a rebuild of a target, remove the corresponding
".done" file, and do the make again.

Benefits and Drawbacks
--------------------
Why does this method even exist, separate from the gar build method?
Some reasons follow:
 1. It's pure Makefile. All maintainers should already be familiar
    with tweaking Makefiles, so it is much, much easier for
    a maintainer to fully understand (and modify, if needed).
    In contrast, there are very few people who understand gar in its
    entirety
 2. It's a single Makefile, which makes it easier to figure out
     "what is going on?"
 3. It's selfcontained. Everything is in the one directory. That means
    you can just copy over the one bit, and you know you have a working
    build tree, no matter what someone else does elsewhere in our svn tree.
 3.1 This also means, you can safely do a small, relative checkout of
       the svn tree, rather than "the whole tree"

Drawbacks:
  1. The self-contained nature, also means that improvements and enhancements
  in the original template file, do not get automatically distributed out to
  older versions.
  On the other hand, the older version is still guaranteed to "work", so
  its not really that important. 
 
  2. Fewer fully automated hooks for "fancy stuff". Requires manual tweaking
  of the prototype file
