This is a README for the "createpkg" style templates in the
OpenCSW subversion tree. It gets copied to a brand new directory, when it
is created with "make createpkg-softwarenamehere"

Instructions:

the first thing you should do, is

  svn status

with this, you will notice that no files in the directory are actually checked
into subversion yet.  You should edit (or remove) the files as you deem 
apropriate, and then

  svn add   filename(s)

the ones you want to keep in the repository.

If you are doing a general-case binary build package, then you will next need
to do the following:

1. Set up your environment variables as appropriate, and/or
  set the appropriate variables in Makefile

2. mkdir build

3.  extract the source tree of whatever you are building, in the build dir.

4. make

You also have a choice of some optional subtargets, such as
  make  {configure,build,package,clean,reallyclean}

If you wish a patch set to be applied to the source before configure, create
a file called "patchfile.preconf" and put them there.

If you wish a patch set to be applied to the source AFTER configure, but
before compiling (for example, to hand-hack config.h) create a file called
"patchfile.postconf"


DONT FORGET to update all fields in the pkginfo file, and also to create
appropriate copyright, depend and prototype files.
If you dont know what to put into
the prototype file, an initial build will most likely bomb out, after creating
one for you in build/*/cswstage/prototype.
