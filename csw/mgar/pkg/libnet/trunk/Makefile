DESCRIPTION = The libnet packet construction library
define BLURB
  Libnet is a high-level API (toolkit) allowing the application programmer to
	construct and inject network packets. It provides a portable and simplified
	interface for low-level network packet shaping, handling and injection.
	Libnet hides much of the tedium of packet creation from the application
	programmer such as multiplexing, buffer management, arcane packet header
	information, byte-ordering, OS-dependent issues, and much more. Libnet
	features portable packet creation interfaces at both the IP-layer and
	link-layer, as well as a host of supplementary and complementary
	functionality.
