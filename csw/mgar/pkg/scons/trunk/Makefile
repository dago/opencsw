DESCRIPTION = A next-generation build tool
define BLURB
  SCons is an Open Source software construction tool - that is,
  a next-generation build tool. Think of SCons as an improved,
  cross-platform substitute for the classic Make utility with
  integrated functionality similar to autoconf/automake and compiler
  caches such as ccache. In short, SCons is an easier, more
  reliable and faster way to build software.
