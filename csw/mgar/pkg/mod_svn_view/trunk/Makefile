DESCRIPTION = Subversion repository viewer
define BLURB
  mod_svn_view provides a web-based view of a Subversion repository, similar
  to Chora, or viewcvs. What makes mod_svn_view different is it uses the
  Subversion libraries directly instead of executing the command line client,
  and thus has tremendous speed. It is also written in C as an Apache 2.0
  module and generates a simple XML output that can be run through XSL
  Transformations via mod_transform to generate a customized look.
