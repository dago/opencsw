DESCRIPTION = IRC client with IPv6, proxy, bot, socks and Perl support
define BLURB
	Irssi is a modular IRC client that currently has only text mode user
	interface, but 80-90% of the code isn't text mode specific, so other UIs
	could be created pretty easily. Also, Irssi isn't really even IRC
	specific anymore, there's already a working SILC module available.
	Support for other protocols like ICQ could be created some day too.
