This is a "quickie" redo of pango, for our X11 recompile project
( http://wiki.opencsw.org/project-x11-reloaded )

It unfortunately does not have 64bit support, because Phil had
 issues when trying to get that to work right. some kind of complaints from
  glib.h includes or some such.

Normally, this would delay release of the package. but since our X11
is in dire straits, higher priority is given to "Fix X11 for 95%
  of everyone" vs "hold this until 64bit is fixed".
