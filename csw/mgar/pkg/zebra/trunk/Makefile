DESCRIPTION = Manages TCP/IP Based Routing Protocols
define BLURB
  GNU Zebra is free software that manages TCP/IP based routing protocols.
  It is released as part of the GNU Project, and it is distributed under the
  GNU General Public License. It supports BGP-4 protocol as described in RFC1771
  (A Border Gateway Protocol 4) as well as RIPv1, RIPv2 and OSPFv2. Unlike traditional,
  monolithic architectures and even the so-called "new modular architectures" that
  remove the burden of processing routing functions from the cpu and utilize special
  ASIC chips instead, Zebra software offers true modularity.
