This package doesnt need much in the way of "building".
This package is a hack around the issue that we dont have legal right
to redistribute isaexec.

You can almost just do pkgmk!

You can use createpkg -r . if you like though.

but remember to rename (SunOS5.8) and uncompress it!

Note: DO NOT COMPRESS/gzip the package!
 (so gzip can use it :-)
