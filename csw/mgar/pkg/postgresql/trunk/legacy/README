Here are my postgresql scripts.

Horrible and ugly, I know :(

All you should need to do is unpack this in a ~/pkgs/ directory, tweak
a few things, and run. My standard was to have my home directory set
up like :

pkgs/<packagename> for all build scripts, copyright, etc.
build-<hostname> for each build host.

And source under /export/medusa/src.

So, on running these, you'd end up with ~/build-<hostname>/postgresql-8.3.3.

The scripts then move parts of the postgresql install into different
staging directories (and, in the case of libpq, unpack a
"compatibility" tarball) and then package them up in to the
appropriate ~/pkgs/<packagename> directories. The compat tarballs
could possibly be removed if everyone relinks their packages when
needed. It's a bit of a pain when a new upstream major version comes
out and you then have to include the previous libraries in...

So you'll end up with packages under postgresql, postgresqlcontrib, and libpq.

For some reason, the last time I tried this, I had to manually go into
the staging directory for postgresqlcontrib and run "createpkg -r ." -
not sure why this didn't work automatically.

Like I say - these are pretty horrible and ugly, particularly the
sparc build script which produces the combined 32/64-bit package. But
they worked for years, so I never got round to moving them into GAR. I
hope these work for you - even though I've left the project, please do
contact me if you have any questions at all about them.
