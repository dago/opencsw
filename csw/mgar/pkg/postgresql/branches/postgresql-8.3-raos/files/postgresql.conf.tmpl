# Example PostgreSQL server configuration file.
# 
# Provided by the OpenCSW package of PostgreSQL.  This file is read by the
# /etc/opt/csw/init.d/cswpostgres startup script, and can be used to override
# the defaults.
#
# Please use alternatives to choose between 32/64bit version of the server.

# The location of the data directory.
# Default : @PGDATA@
PGDATA=@PGDATA@

# Additional options to pass to postmaster.
# 
# These options will be passed to the postmaster program. The most common use
# of these is to allow network access to PostgreSQL from other hosts over
# TCP/IP.  This is done by using the flags "-o -i", as in the example below.
# Uncomment this line to enable network access to PostgreSQL.  Note that you
# will still need to configure authentication in the pg_hba.conf in your data
# directory.
# 
# SERVEROPTS="-o -i"
