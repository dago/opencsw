Although I can't promise anything in the way of support, I'd be
interested to hear about your experiences using it (good or bad).  I'm
also interested in hearing bug reports and suggestions for improvement
even though I can't promise to implement them.

If you send me a bug, fix, or question, include the version of Expect
(as reported by expect -d), version of Tcl, and name and version of
the OS that you are using.  Before sending mail, it may be helpful to
verify that your problem still exists in the latest version.  You can
check on the current release and whether it addresses your problems by
retrieving the latest HISTORY file (see "History" above).


Awards, love letters, and bug reports may be sent to:
