DESCRIPTION = Combined traceroute and ping utility
define BLURB
  mtr combines the functionality of the 'traceroute' and 'ping' programs
  in a single network diagnostic tool.
  
  As mtr starts, it investigates the network connection between the host
  mtr runs on and a user-specified destination host. After it determines
  the address of each network hop between the machines, it sends a
  sequence ICMP ECHO requests to each one to determine the quality of the
  link to each machine. As it does this, it prints running statistics
  about each machine.
