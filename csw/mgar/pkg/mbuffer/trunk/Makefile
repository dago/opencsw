DESCRIPTION = A tool for buffering data streams
define BLURB
  mbuffer is a tool for buffering data streams. Its special feature is to show
  the I/O rate and summary to the user. It is especially useful, if you are
  writing backups to fast tape drives or libraries. Those drives tend to stop
  and rewind if they have a buffer underrun. This so called tape screwing
  reduces the lifetime of the motors. mbuffer can prevent buffer underruns,
  if used correctly and speed up the whole backup process.
