DESCRIPTION = LZO file compressor
define BLURB
  lzop is a file compressor which is very similar to gzip. lzop uses the LZO
  data compression library for compression services, and its main advantages
  over gzip are much higher compression and decompression speed (at the cost
  of some compression ratio).
