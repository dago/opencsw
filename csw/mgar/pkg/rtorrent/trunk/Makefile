DESCRIPTION = BitTorrent client.
define BLURB
  BitTorrent library written in C++ for *nix, with a focus on high performance and good code.
  The library differentiates itself from other implementations by transfering directly from
  file pages to the network stack. On high-bandwidth connections it is able to seed at 3 times
  the speed of the official client.
