DESCRIPTION = Perl-compatible regular expression tools
define BLURB
  The PCRE library is a set of functions that implement regular
  expression pattern matching using the same syntax and semantics
  as Perl 5. PCRE has its own native API, as well as a set of
  wrapper functions that correspond to the POSIX regular expression API.
