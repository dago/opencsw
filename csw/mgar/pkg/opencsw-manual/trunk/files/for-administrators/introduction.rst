The world of open source is big. Although Solaris releases do contain the
software companion disc, there's always more projects out there that can fit
there.

OpenCSW fills this gap by providing binary packages, together with their build
recipes.  The packages can be installed comfortably with automatic dependency
resolution, and require root access to the machine. If you want to compile and
build packages on your own, the build recipes are available for all packages
too.

Solaris 10 is fully supported. Solaris 8 and 9 only get best effort support
level.  As of January 2012, Solaris 8 catalogs do not get any updates, and
Solaris 9 catalogs only get some amount of updates.
