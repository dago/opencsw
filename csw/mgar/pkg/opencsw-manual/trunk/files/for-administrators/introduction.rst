System administrators have to work with software every day. Solaris brings
more and more programs with every release. However, the world of open source is
big and there is always missing something. OpenCSW fills this gap by providing
a large amount of precompiled software and open source build recipes.
The p√ackages can be installed comfortably with automatic dependency resolution
but require root access to the machine. If you really want to compile your
own software the build recipes are available for all packages too.

Solaris 10 is fully supported whereas Solaris 8 and 9 are best effort
and only get sporadic updates.
