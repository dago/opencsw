Contributing to recipes
-----------------------

It often happens that a maintainer wants to make a change or an update to
another maintainer's package.


- The maintainer is retired:

  On the maintainers mailing list, announce your intention to work on
  the recipe and eventually take up the maintenance.

  When you have a working recipe and generated the package, upload-it
  and you became the active maintainer.

- The maintainer is inactive:

  Contact them before starting your work, and allow them 1 to 2 weeks to
  respond. If you don't get an answer, proceed as described above.

- The maintainer is active, i.e. answers to bug reports, messages sent
  on the maintainers mailing list or private messages:

  `Work in a branch`_, and when you obtain satisfying results explain your
  changes to the maintainer such as he or she can use what you've done and/or,
  if you obtain his or her explicit permission, merge your modifications on
  the trunk.
