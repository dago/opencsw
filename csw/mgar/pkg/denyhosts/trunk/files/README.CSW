### OpenCSW denyhosts README

Please make sure, you have configured syslogd and sshd 
to log the auth messages. 
sshd defaults to auth.info on Solaris, so an entry for 
/etc/syslog.conf could look like:

[snip]
auth.info               /var/log/authlog
[snap]

Please configure /etc/opt/csw/denyhosts.cfg accordingly:

[snip]
SECURE_LOG = /var/log/authlog
[snap]

Restart syslogd and denyhosts for the changes to take effect.
