DESCRIPTION = Seek out and destroy all forms of Bill
define BLURB
  Ever get the feeling that nothing is going right? You're a sysadmin,
  and someone's trying to destroy your computers. The little people
  running around the screen are trying to infect your computers with
  Wingdows [TM], a virus cleverly designed to resemble a popular
  operating system. Additionally, some computers are connected with
  network cables. When one computer on a network becomes infected,
  a spark will be sent down the cable, and will infect the computer
  on the other end when it reaches there.
