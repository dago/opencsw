  Xerces-C++ is a validating XML parser written in a portable subset
  of C++. Xerces-C++ makes it easy to give your application the ability
  to read and write XML data. A shared library is provided for parsing,
  generating, manipulating, and validating XML documents using the DOM,
  SAX, and SAX2 APIs. For an introduction to programming with Xerces-C++
 refer to the Programming Guide.
