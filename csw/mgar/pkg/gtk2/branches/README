Still need to do:  run strip on 64bit libs, cleanly
  plus redo sparcv9 package, fix prototypes for
    " opt/..."


Quickie rebuild of our gtk packge(s), to make the CSW-X11 clean.

prototype file tweaking:
  remove .la files from /opt/csw/lib, but NOT modules dir or elsewhere
  DOC_REGEX=gtk-doc
  DEVEL_REGEX='[/]include[/]|aclocal|pkgconfig|demo'
    #use egrep for the above

  d none /opt/csw/share/gtk-doc 0755 root bin
  f none /opt/csw/share/gtk-doc/COPYING.gtk2=COPYING 0644 root bin


SOLARIS 9 PATCHING NOTE::

  Apparently, suns' patching is BROKEN!!
   x86 latest patch set gets PROPER version of file for
   /usr/openwin/share/include/X11/Xlibint.h
   **sparc does not** !!!
  So.. have to manually copy x86 version of file over to sparc, then it works!

   Oddity: the sun fingerprint database is corrupted !!

  --------------------------------------------------


Fix whine about cannot find "default local directory monitor"?
   but that is from libgio-2.0.so?
 but actualy also triggered through libFAM failage.
 erm...?

some websites believe :-- 
 "makes me believe that it is caused by the gtk_file_chooser* code in
  gtkoptions.c. Probably a missing directory that the gtk code expects to be
  there."



PROLEMS WITH COMPILE:
gdk/x11/gdkasync.c will **not compile**,unless SUNWxwinc is up to date.
 (Xlibint.h copied from the x86 version, as mentioned above)

otherwise, it will error out with

"gdkasync.c", line 280: undefined symbol: X_
"gdkasync.c", line 280: syntax error before or at: GetInputFocus
