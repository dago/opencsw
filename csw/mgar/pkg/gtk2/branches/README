Quickie rebuild of our gtk packge(s), to make the CSW-X11 clean.

SOLARIS 9 PATCHING NOTE::

  Apparently, suns' patching is BROKEN!!
   x86 latest patch set gets PROPER version of file for
   /usr/openwin/share/include/X11/Xlibint.h
   **sparc does not** !!!
  So.. have to manually copy x86 version of file over to sparc, then it works!

Oddity: the sun fingerprint database is corrupted !!

  --------------------------------------------------

notes for hand-tweaking gtk prototype file:

remove .la files from /opt/csw/lib, but NOT modules dir or elsewhere



Fix whine about cannot find "default local directory monitor"?
   but that is from libgio-2.0.so?
 but actualy also triggered through libFAM failage.
 erm...?

some websites believe :-- 
 "makes me believe that it is caused by the gtk_file_chooser* code in
  gtkoptions.c. Probably a missing directory that the gtk code expects to be
  there."
