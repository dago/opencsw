Quickie rebuild of our gtk packge(s), to make the CSW-X11 clean.

notes for hand-tweaking prototype file:

remove .la files from /opt/csw/lib, but NOT modules dir or elsewhere



Fix whine about cannot find "default local directory monitor"?
   but that is from libgio-2.0.so?
 but actualy also triggered through libFAM failage.
 erm...?

some websites believe,
"makes me believe that it is
 caused by the gtk_file_chooser* code in gtkoptions.c. Probably a
 missing directory that the gtk code expects to be there."
