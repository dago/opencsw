Subject: [PATCH] Do not perform acceptance test

Why? Accpetance tests are using CFEngine's $(WORKDIR) which is set to /var/opt/csw/cfengine3 and regular users, i.e. the guy who is building CFEngine does not have rw access to it, nor can it be created by non-root users. Thus, all tests fail.

Having CFEngine running on several Sol10 machines, I guess this counts as test.
