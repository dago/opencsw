BCFEngine 3
----------

* The working directory is located at /var/opt/csw/cfengine3.

* Upon first installation, a private/public key will be
  auto-generated and stored in $(sys.workdir)/ppkeys.

* Symlinks to /opt/csw/sbin/cf-agent, /opt/csw/sbin/cf-promises are
  auto-created in $(sys.workdir)/bin.

* Options to the daemons can be passed by using
  /etc/opt/csw/cfengine3rc or /opt/csw/etc/cfengine3rc. The former
  takes precedence over the latter.

* By default, /etc/opt/csw/cfengine3rc defines a class `opencsw' for
  cf-execd and cf-serverd.

* CFengine has been compiled without support for PostgreSQL, MySQL,
  and SQLite.

* Restarting the daemons (especially cf-execd) in fast sequence may
  lead to the service going in maintenance mode when using SMF (or
  just not having the daemon started when using legacy startup
  scritps). This is due to the locking mechanism used by CFEngine.

* Starting with CFEngine 3.3.0, support for Berkeley DB was dropped by
  CFEngine developers, and Tokyocabinet is used instead. Therefore, if
  you upgrade from pre 3.3.0 CFEngine, there will be stale *.db files
  in $(sys.workdir) (/var/opt/csw/cfengine3 by default). Those can be
  removed.
