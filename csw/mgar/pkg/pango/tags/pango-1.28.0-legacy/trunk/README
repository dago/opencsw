This is a "quickie" redo of pango, for our X11 recompile project
( http://wiki.opencsw.org/project-x11-reloaded )

ALthough it's now becoming a little less "quickie" and a bit more
"proper".
64bit issues have been resolved.

It is in here, rather than in pkg/pango, because the software 'name'
is libpango, so I thought this was the right dirname to use.


PROBLEM SHOOTING:

  'strip' (at least in cwstage) is BROKEN?
    somehow eliminates the pango_fc_font_map_cache_ symbols from
      libpangoft2-1.0.so, at least in sparc build
    Somethin about bad fakeroot interaction.
    So we call stagepkg with -m here.

If amd64 blows up about g-ir-scanner, then just remove it from config.status
(Set INTROSPECTION_SCANNER to "")
Actually, set all INTROSPECTION stuff to "", and then set
S["HAVE_INTROSPECTION_FALSE"]=""
S["HAVE_INTROSPECTION_TRUE"]="#"

eeeexcept that doesnt seem to be enough, so we force --enable-introspection=no
for the 64bit configs


x86 also gets picky about the staging. Some problem with libfakeroot, at
least on our build machine setup?

You May have to manually redo the 32bit staging with
  cd build/*;
  gmake DESTDIR=$PWD/cswstage install



TWEAKS FOR prototype files:



*. include and pkgconfig files get split out into _devel. (see subdir)
*. htmldoc gets split into _doc. 
*. everything else stays in top level. 

*. To get the 64bit libby stuffs, fgrep out "csw/lib" from a "pure" 
   prototype, and then  sed s:/lib/:/lib/sparcv9/:  or amd64, as appropriate
   Dont forget to update the devel package prototype if needed

*. strip out .la files from top libdirs, but NOT from "modules" dirs!
