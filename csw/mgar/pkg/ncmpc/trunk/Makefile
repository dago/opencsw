DESCRIPTION = ncurses client for controlling Music Player Daemons (MPD)
define BLURB
ncmpc is a curses client for the Music Player Daemon (MPD). 
ncmpc connects to a MPD running on a machine on the local
network, and controls this with an interface inspired by
cplay. If ncmpc is used with lirc and irpty it can be used
to manage playlists and control MPD with a remote control.
