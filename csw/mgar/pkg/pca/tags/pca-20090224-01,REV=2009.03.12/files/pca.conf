#
# PCA - Patch Check Advanced
#
# The template for this configuration file is associated to version 5.3
# if you currently use a newer version, please check if you need to update
# this file.
#
#
#
# The behaviour of pca can be configured by setting any option either in this  
# configuration file, or as an environment variable with the PCA_ prefix or on
# the command line. 
#
# See man page for pca for a complete list of allowed options
#
# At first, this configuration file is read from the following locations :
#
#    /opt/csw/bin/pca.conf
#    /opt/csw/etc/pca.conf
#    /etc/pca.conf
#    $HOME/.pca 
#    pca.conf in the current directory
#
# in this order. Options are set by specifying option=value in the file. 
#
#    Example: To set the path of the wget command, use wget=/opt/csw/bin/wget 
#             To enable debug output, use debug=1.
#
# The values defined in this configuration file can be supereded at runtime.
#
# After reading the values from the first configuration file, all environment 
# variables matching PCA_OPTION are read. 
#
#    Example: To set the patch download directory, set PCA_PATCHDIR to 
#             /some/dir/. 
#             To set the noheader option, set PCA_NOHEADER to 1.
#
# At last, the command line options are read. Example: To set the location of 
# the patch xref file, use -X /tmp or --xrefdir=/tmp. To set the option for 
# safe patch installation, use -s or --safe.
#
#
#
# The following value is set by default in the Blastwave package
#
#    wget=/opt/csw/bin/wget
