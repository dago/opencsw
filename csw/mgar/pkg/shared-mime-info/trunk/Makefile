DESCRIPTION = Freedesktop.org common MIME database
define BLURB
  The shared-mime-info package contains the core database of common types and
  the *update-mime-database* command used to extend it. It requires glib2 to be
  installed for building the update command. Additionally, it uses intltool for
  translations, though this is only a dependency for the maintainers. This
  database is translated at Transifex.
