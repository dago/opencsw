DESCRIPTION = A tool for administering Networks of Diverse Machines
define BLURB
  Cfengine is a tool for setting up and maintaining BSD and System-5-like
  operating system optionally attached to a TCP/IP network. You can think of
  cfengine as a very high level language, much higher level than Perl or shell:
  a single statement can result in many hundreds of operations being performed
  on multiple hosts. Cfengine is good at performing a lot of common system
  administration tasks, and allows you to build on its strengths with your own
  scripts. You can also use it as a netwide front-end for `cron'.
