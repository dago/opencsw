 *
 * This program reads in a PNG image, and writes it out again, with the
 * optimum filter_method and zlib_level.  It uses brute force (trying
 * filter_method none, and libpng adaptive filtering, with compression
 * levels 3 and 9).
 *
 * Optionally, it can remove unwanted chunks or add gAMA, sRGB, bKGD,
 * tEXt/zTXt, and tRNS chunks.  It will remove some chunks such as gAMA,
 * cHRM, pHYs, and oFFs when their data fields contain all zero, which is a
 * mistake.
 *
 * Uses libpng and zlib.  This program was based upon libpng's pngtest.c.
 *
 * Thanks to Greg Roelofs for various bug fixes, suggestions, and
 * occasionally creating Linux executables.
 *
 * Thanks to Stephan Levavej for some helpful suggestions about gcc compiler
 * options and for a suggestion to increase the Z_MEM_LEVEL from default.
