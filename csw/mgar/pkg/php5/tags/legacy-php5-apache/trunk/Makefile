DESCRIPTION = A high-level scripting language.
define BLURB
  PHP is a widely-used Open Source general-purpose scripting language that is
  especially suited for Web development and can be embedded into HTML. Its
  syntax draws upon C, Java, and Perl, and is easy to learn. PHP runs on many
  different platforms and can be used as a standalone executable or as a
  module under a variety of Web servers. It has excellent support for
  databases, XML, LDAP, IMAP, Java, various Internet protocols, and general
  data manipulation, and is extensible via its powerful API. It is actively
  developed and supported by a talented and energetic international team.
  Numerous Open Source and commercial PHP-based application packages are
  available.
