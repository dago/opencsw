DESCRIPTION = Tunnels network connections through a HTTPS proxy
define BLURB
  ProxyTunnel is a program that connects stdin and stdout to a server somewhere
  on the network, through a standard HTTPS proxy. We mostly use it to tunnel 
  SSH sessions through HTTP(S) proxies, allowing us to do many things that 
  wouldn't be possible without ProxyTunnel.
