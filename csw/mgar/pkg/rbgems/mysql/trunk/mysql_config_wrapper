# Due to the way the gem command works, patching the source doesn't
# help.  We need a way to filter the output of mysql_config directly.
# This is ugly, but mysql_config --libs passes values like -m32,
# -xarch= and -norunpath that make ld barf.  This is likely a mysql
# bug but I need to do further investigation before filing it and want
# to proceed with other tasks first
