DESCRIPTION = Produce documentation for one or more Ruby source files
define BLURB
  RDoc is an application that produces documentation for one or more Ruby source files. RDoc includes the +rdoc+ and +ri+ tools for generating and displaying online documentation. At this point in time, RDoc 2.x is a work in progress and may incur further API changes beyond what has been made to RDoc 1.0.1. Command-line tools are largely unaffected, but internal APIs may shift rapidly. See RDoc for a description of RDoc's markup and basic use.
