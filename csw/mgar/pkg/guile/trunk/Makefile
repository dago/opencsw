# 2009-11-15: The package builds successfully with GCC (not with sun cc).
#             The version in the catalog (1.6.7,REV=2005.07.03) includes the .a

#             not quite sure what's the correct approach here.

DESCRIPTION = GNU extensibility library
define BLURB
	Guile is a library designed to help programmers create flexible applications. Using Guile in an application allows programmers to write plug-ins, or modules (there are many names, but the concept is essentially the same) and users to use them to have an application fit their needs.
