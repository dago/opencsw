Link-time Libraries:

The following libraries are redistributable with object files and libraries that 
clients link into programs:

    * libCCexcept.so.1
      You would need to ship libCCexcept.so.1 with your product only when all of 
these conditions are met:
          o You supply libraries and .o files to be linked into a program by 
your clients, and
          o Your code contains binaries created by Sun C++, and
          o Some binaries in the final program might have been created by a 
version of Sun Studio earlier than Sun Studio 8, and
          o Your clients are not expected to have Sun Studio, and
          o You provide a script or makefile that does the linking using ld 
directly instead of using CC. 

      Beginning with Sun Studio 8, the Sun C++ compiler (C++ 5.5) changed the 
way it emitted data about C++ exceptions in object files, putting data in 
previously unused fields. If C++ object files created by earlier compilers 
were linked directly with object files created by C++ 5.5 or later, C++ 
exceptions might not work correctly.

      The Solaris linker (ld) has an interface whereby "helper libraries" 
can be provided to perform extra processing on object files. The CC driver 
tells the linker to use libCCexcept.so.1 to process object files, converting 
old-style exception data to the new format in memory at program link time. 
(The original object files are not modified.)

      Library libCCexcept.so.1 is used only by the Solaris linker when 
creating an executable program or shared library. The library is never linked 
to user programs. The library is included in Sun Studio, so ISVs do not 
normally need to supply the library to their clients.

    * libldstab_ws.so.1
      You would need to ship libldstab_ws with your product only when all of 
these conditions are met:
          o You supply libraries and .o files to be linked into a program by 
your clients, and
          o Your libraries or .o files contain stab information, and
          o You did NOT compile with option "-xs", which causes stabs to 
be copied to the executable, and
          o Your clients are not expected to have Sun Studio 

      N_OBJ index stabs require processing by the linker to insert the 
directory and file name of the object file being linked.

      The Solaris linker (ld) has an interface whereby "helper libraries" 
can be provided to perform extra processing on object files. The CC driver 
tells the linker to use libldstab_ws.so to process object files, filling in 
the N_OBJ stabs at program link time. (The original object files are not 
modified.)

      Library libldstab_ws.so.1 is used only by the Solaris linker when 
creating an executable program or shared library. The library is never 
linked to user programs. The library is included in Sun Studio, so ISVs 
do not normally need to supply the library to their clients.
