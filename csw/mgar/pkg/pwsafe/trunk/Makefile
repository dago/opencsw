DESCRIPTION = command-line password database.
define BLURB
  pwsafe is a command line password database program for Unix. It is compatible
  with Counterpane's Win32 Password Safe software. It can also copy the
  passwords into the X selection and clipboard, but it doesn't open a visible
  window. The encrypted password database uses the same format as Password Safe
  1.9.x. The database is encrypted with blowfish, and a single passphrase
  decrypts it all.
