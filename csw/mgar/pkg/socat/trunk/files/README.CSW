Known issues
------------
Some of the IP4/IP6 socket options related to ancillary messages don't
work with this build. This comprises ip-recvopts, ip-recvttl and alike
and seems to be a known socat portability issue.

See "IP4 and IP6 option groups" in the socat man page. Options marked as
Linux and/or *BSD won't work.
