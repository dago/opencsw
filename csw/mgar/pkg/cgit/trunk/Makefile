DESCRIPTION = Web front-end for Git
define BLURB
cgit is 
 * a cgi application implemented in C: it's basically (yet) another git command, used to generate html.
 * not forking: all git operations are performed by linking with libgit.a.
 * using a built-in cache: the generated html is stored on disk for the benefit of later requests.
 * fond of virtual urls - using PATH_INFO or modules like mod_rewrite makes cgit generate urls with few or no querystring parameters, e.g.
 * http://hjemli.net/git/cgit/log/Makefile vs.
 * http://hjemli.net/git?r=cgit&p=log&path=Makefile.
 * not too visual, but sometimes a bit of graphics can be justified.
 * open source - it is licensed under GPL v2.
 * maintained by Lars Hjemli, who is happy to receive patches, suggestions and bug reports.
