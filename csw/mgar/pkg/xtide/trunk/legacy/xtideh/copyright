# Dear David,
#
# This letter is to confirm that we are happy for you to download the
# sea level data from the British Oceanographic Data Centre website and
# use this in the generation of harmonic constants using the HarmGen
# software.  However there are a couple of things that we would politely
# ask that you do.
#
# 1.  Limit the number of harmonic constants you use in the software to
# a maximum of 40 for any port.  This should easily be enough to create
# very accurate tidal predictions as for nearly all locations, any
# harmonics left out (i.e. the 41st most significant constants onwards)
# will have amplitudes of the order of a centimetre.
#
# 2.  State that the data is derived from sea level data obtained from
# the British Oceanographic Data Centre based at the Proudman
# Oceanographic Laboratory, Liverpool.
#
# 3.  Make it clear that the predictions however are not the same as
# those computed by the Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory which uses its
# own sets of harmonic constants.
#
# 4.  Continue to make your software using the data freely available.
# Please inform us if you intend to produce a software product that you
# will be making a charge for.
#
# I hope these conditions are acceptable to you and it will be good to
# see the UK back on the map.
#
# Yours sincerely,
# Colin Bell
# Head of Applications Group

#
# Imported NOS data from snapshot 2007-12-17.
#
# Reapplied the meridian fixes for Albany and Coyote Point Marina.
# Coordinates of I-526 bridge were fixed upstream.
#
# A comparison of all reference stations versus the 2008 tide tables
# published on the web revealed discrepancies for Anchorage, AK and Port
# O'Connor, TX.  The Anchorage discrepancies are small enough to be
# explained by a data update; however, the Port O'Connor discrepancies are
# major and are not helped by the meridian fix that worked for Albany and
# Coyote Point Marina.  Local observations are required to determine whether
# the Port O'Connor predictions are any good at all.  This is complicated by
# the fact that it is a diurnal station with small tidal range, making
# eyewitness confirmation that much more unreliable.  Subordinate stations
# depending on these reference stations will also fail to match the
# published tables.
#
#
# 2007-11-22
#
# To facilitate compliance with Linux distribution packaging policies
# and to draw more attention to the acceptable use restriction on
# non-U.S. data, the "free" and "nonfree" data are now being exported
# to separate TCD files.  At this time, all "free" data are public
# domain and all "nonfree" data are merely restricted to
# non-commercial use only.
#
# Replaced the data set for Harwich, England with one calculated from
# a longer time series.  Proudman still does not yet publish
# predictions for this location.
#
#
# 2007-03-18
#
# Updated approximated MLLW datums with improved estimates.
#
# Put IGNORE HEIGHTS in the legalese fields of the 14 subordinate
# stations where NOS zeroed out the heights.
#
#
# 2007-02-22
#
# Applied renamings as updated and improved by Walt Bilofsky (thanks
# Walt).
#
#
# 2007-02-11
#
# Interim release, without renamings.
#
# Imported NOS data from snapshot 2007-02-07.
#
# (9414449) Coyote Point Marina, San Francisco Bay, CA:  corrected meridian.
#           (Data claimed UTC, was UTC-8)
# (8518995) Albany, Hudson River, NY:  corrected meridian.
#           (Data claimed UTC, was UTC-5)
# I-526 bridge, Ashley River, South Carolina:  fixed longitude.
# Pascagoula, Mississippi Sound, Mississippi latitude was fixed upstream.
#
# In progress:  renamings.
#
# Since there were two reference stations with incorrect meridians
# (one that was reported last time and one that was just discovered),
# it is reasonable to expect that there will be more.
#
#
# 2006-07-08
#
# Coyote Point Marina, San Francisco Bay, California:  corrected meridian.
# Delaware City, Delaware River, Delweare:  fixed typo in name.
# Pascagoula, Mississippi Sound, Mississippi:  fixed latitude.
# I-526 bridge, Ashley River, South Carolina:  fixed longitude.
#
#
# 2006-03-05
#
# Installed renamings from AH for the 102 stations that lacked states.
#
#
# 2006-02-05
#
# Refreshed U.S. data from NOS web site (snapshot 2006-01-04).  AH has
# dealt with new and modified station names to maintain the naming
# convention installed 2005-11-27.  Still to be fixed is a list of
# stations that do not include their state in their name.  Most or all
# of those have been that way since November.  They didn't stick out
# much until an unrelated Harmbase query happened to group them
# together.
#
# An e-mail exchange with Todd Ehret of NOS CO-OPS this time led me to
# believe that the UTC constants for the Alaskan reference stations
# with weird time zones should be correct, so I have retained them.  A
# survey of affected subordinate stations shows that most should be
# correct if their reference station is correct (they all use the same
# one).  Most doubtful are the six subordinate stations on
# St. Lawrence Island.  I do not even have reliable intelligence on
# what the de facto time zone of St. Lawrence Island is.  It was not
# mentioned in the statute that defines U.S. time zones.
#
#
# 2005-11-27
#
# Installed renamings from August Hahn to achieve something like the
# naming convention previously followed in legacy data.  These
# renamings will be maintained through subsequent updates if the churn
# is not too bad.
#
#
# 2005-09-05
#
# Generated and installed harmonic constants for 49 Canadian stations
# using up to 10 years of hourly data (the maximum permitted download)
# from Marine Environmental Data Services (MEDS), Fisheries and Oceans
# Canada.
#
# MEDS publishes water level data for 962 stations.  Of those, only 92
# are currently active.  Of those 92, 43 are non-tidal, being located
# on or near the great lakes.
# 
#
# 2005-06-05
#
# Generated and installed fresh harmonic constants for U.K. stations
# using all available data for the 19 year epoch from 1986 to 2004.
# Quality assurance information is available at

# Station Harwich, England is new with only 8 months of data.
# Authoritative predictions for this station are not yet available for

#
# 2005-01-20
#
# Deleted the following Alaskan reference stations, which were
# rendered incorrect by technical difficulties confirmed by Todd Ehret

#
# Rebuilt using libtcd 1.99, which corrects a problem where

#
#
# 2004-09-14 DWF
#
# Imported subordinate stations available from the NOS web site as of
# 2004-09-09.  Compare against
# http://co-ops.nos.noaa.gov/tide_pred.html.  Some stations will
# disagree moderately because the reference stations were updated and
# don't match the published tables.
#
# The smattering of sub stations in non-U.S. territory was suppressed.
#
# There are time zone problems in Alaska.  The LST used by the NOS for
# stations in Alaska does not always match the local statutory time
# zone (which I have followed).  For reference stations, the problem
# was detectable and correctable because the constants were available
# calibrated with UTC as well as LST.  But for the sub stations, it is
# impossible to tell whether a disagreement with NOS predictions
# results from a disagreement about time zone, incorrect calibration,
# or both.
#
# A few names suffixed by (A) and (B) reflect sub stations on the NOS
# web site with the same names and close coordinates, where it is far
# from obvious why there are two of them.  Other name clashes were
# resolved by disambiguation.
#
# (Nit) Corrected months_on_station for German ref stations from 13 to
# 12.  (It's a time zone / rounding issue, on list to be fixed.)
#
#
# 2004-09-07c DWF
#
# Put the following three stations on Eastern time (they were calibrated
# to Central time on the NOS web site):
#   Johns Island, Chassahowitzka Bay, FL
#   Chassahowitzka River, FL
#   Crystal River, Kings Bay, FL
#
#
# 2004-09-07b DWF
#
# Corrected heuristic for Alaskan time zones.  A few stations in the
# Aleutians were affected.
#
#
# 2004-09-07 DWF
#
# Added notes for stations in Alaska where the LST used by NOS does not
# match the apparent statutory time zone.  Presently these notes just
# get attached to the comments field in the TCD file, but the next major
# revision to the TCD format should enable XTide to display them more
# prominently.
#
#
# 2004-09-01 DWF
#
# Most reference stations available from the NOS web site as of
# 2004-08-26 have been imported.  Compare against
# http://co-ops.nos.noaa.gov/tide_pred.html.
#
# MLLW benchmarks were not available for all stations.  For stations
# where a MLLW datum was not available, the datum has been set to LAT.
#
# I know there are typos in the location names.
#
# Currents are not available at this time.  According to Mr. Ehret, they
# will become available when the new CO-OPS currents database is
# complete.
#
# The following stations, which are located in jurisdictions that are
# neither territories of the U.S., nor commonwealths associated with the
# U.S., nor countries with a Compact of Free Association with the U.S.,
# have been dropped.  Their data are distributed without legalese from
# the NOS web site; however, that does not necessarily mean that anyone
# other than the NOS has permission from the respective governments to
# use or redistribute the data.  This may seem paranoid, but the
# situation with the U.K. data that were pulled in 2001 was very
# similar.

# This is an interim release as I am starting over from scratch using
# Harmbase2.  All legacy data have been dumped.
#
# All U.S. data are temporarily down; the 2004-08-09 version of this
# file remains usable for those.  Mr. Ehret has indicated that there
# would be fees involved in obtaining harmonic constants and offsets
# in the format previously received, so I am abandoning all that and
# gearing up to scrape data off of the web.  According to Mr. Ehret,
# the set of locations on the web site is a superset of those used in
# published prediction tables.  The discrepancies that occur are
# because the harmonic constants on the web are updated continuously
# while the harmonic constants used for the published tables are fixed
# in advance.  Thus there seems little to be lost by replacing all of
# the legacy data with a snapshot of the web data.
#
# Data presently included:
#
# Netherlands reference stations computed from hourly levels 1999
# through 2002, as received from Koos Doekes on 2004-02-03.  Compare
# against http://www.getij.nl/engels/.
#
# German reference stations computed using Harmgen from year 2001
# observations sent by Wolfgang Lange on 2004-08-19.  The datums are
# adjusted to LAT.  Compare against
# http://www.bsh.de/en/Marine%20data/Forecasts/Tides/index.jsp.  (The
# web site is still using the MLWS datum, so the heights will disagree
# strongly until the web site is updated.  However, even adjusting for
# that, the agreement is not as good as could be hoped.  The BSH
# predictions are made using a non-harmonic method, so some
# discrepancies are inevitable.)
#
# German subordinate stations as sent by Wolfgang Lange on 2004-08-10.
#
# U.K. reference stations computed using Harmgen from at least four
# years of observations ending 2002-12-31, as downloaded from the BODC
# web site 2003-11.  Compare against http://www.pol.ac.uk/ntslf/tides/.

#
# harmonics-dwf is a new database that emphasizes responsiveness to
# updates and traceability to authoritative sources instead of maximum
# coverage of locations and historical predictions.  All data known to
# be old and expired and all data for which no source of updates
# exists have been purged.  This will orphan many users who have been
# getting good results from old data.  For these, please continue to
# use RMK's database.
#
# harmonics-dwf now contains:
#   - U.S. reference stations provided by Todd Ehret of NOAA circa
#     2004-02-04.
#   - Netherlands reference stations provided by Koos Doekes of the
#     Rijkswaterstaat RIKZ/ZDI (then RIKZ/MII) on 2004-02-03.
#   - U.K. reference stations derived by Harmgen from BODC data,
#     2003-11.
#   - The most recent data for other U.S. reference stations that
#     were in RMK data rev. 2004-04-16 23:30 but not included in
#     the distribution from Todd Ehret.
#
# All sub stations are gone temporarily while I update my software to
# import the sub station data sent by Todd Ehret in February.  I will
# also be contacting Mr. Ehret to see if I can obtain a complete dump
# of all stations in current use so that I can build a legacy-free
# database.
