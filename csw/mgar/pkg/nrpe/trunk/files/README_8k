(1) General

In this package two types of nrpe binaries are included:
- binaries which support sending / receiving 1 kB of data
- binaries which support sending / receiving 8 kB of data

The version for 1 kB of data (default in most distributions) contains:
- binary for the agent: nrpe_1k
- binary for the Nagios plugin: check_nrpe

The version for 8 kB of data contains:
- binary for the agent: nrpe_8k
- binary for Nagios plugin: check_nrpe_8k


(2) On the Nagios side:

Example service configuration:

define service{
	.
	.
	.
	; for up to 8 kB of data
	check_command	check_nrpe_8k!<arguments>
}

define service{
	.
	.
	.
	; for up to 1 kB of data
	check_command	check_nrpe!<arguments>
}

Example Nagios command config:

# 'check_nrpe' command definition
define command{
        command_name    check_nrpe
        command_line    $USER1$/check_nrpe -H $HOSTADDRESS$ -c $ARG1$
        }

# 'check_nrpe_8k' command definition
define command{
        command_name    check_nrpe_8k
        command_line    $USER1$/check_nrpe_8k -H $HOSTADDRESS$ -c $ARG1$
        }


(3) On the agent side:

/opt/csw/bin/nrpe is by default a link to /opt/csw/bin/nrpe_1k. If you want to
submit more then 1 kB of data just set the link to /opt/csw/bin/nrpe_8k and 
restart the NRPE service.

Don't forget to set the check command in your service configuration on the 
Nagios side accordingly (see (2)).
