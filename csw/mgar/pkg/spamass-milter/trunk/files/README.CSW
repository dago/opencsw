You can customize spamass-milter startup options by editing
/etc/opt/csw/spamass-milter. Please see /etc/opt/csw/spamass-milter.CSW for
more information.

Site wide configuration can be put into
/opt/csw/etc/spamass-milter. Configuration in /etc/opt/csw/spamass-milter takes
precedence over /opt/csw/etc/spamass-milter, though.
