This small package performs logging on package maintenance actions.
It logs install, upgrade and removal actions to the user.notice
facility.  Successes and failures are logged.  There are no options
for these scripts.  They are always active.  Remove the package to
disable them.

For this functionality to work, you must use a package management tool
that supports the hook functionality described at:

http://wiki.opencsw.org/package-hooks

Currently, this means pkgutil v1.7 or later.

These scripts are licensed under the GPL v3.
