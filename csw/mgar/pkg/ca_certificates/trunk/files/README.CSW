Notes for ca_certificates
-------------------------

The ca_certificates package provides common Certification Authorities to 
allow ssl-based software to check the validity of certificates exchanged 
during a SSL connection.
It also provides a simple way to configure which CA is considered valid and
to add new custom certificate to the set of CA.

Currently the CA provided by this package are the ones that are shipped with
the mozilla firefox browser.

Quick Usage FAQ:

* How to disable a certificate ?

Just edit the /etc/opt/csw/ca-certificates.conf file and add the full path of the
certificate prefixed by an exclamation mark, then launch:

	/opt/csw/sbin/update-ca-certificates

For exemple, to remove the Equifax Secure CA from the valid CA, add the following 
line in /opt/csw/etc/ca-certificates.conf:

	!/opt/csw/share/ca-certificates/mozilla/Equifax_Secure_CA.crt

and launch /opt/csw/sbin/update-ca-certificates

For CA provided by ca-certificates, you can just put the filename, as by default 
update-ca-certificates will look under /opt/csw/share/ca-certificates/.

For Equifax Secure CA you could just add the line:

	!Equifax_Secure_CA.crt


* How to add a new certificate ?

To add a CA not provided by the ca-certificates package, you first need to install
the openssl_utils package so update-ca-certificates will be able to generate the
hash of the certificate using the openssl binary:

	pkg-get install openssl_utils (or pkg-util -i openssl_utils)

Then either you add the full location of the certificate in /etc/opt/csw/ca-certificates.conf
or you just copy the certificate in /etc/opt/csw/ssl/certs and make sure it has a 
pem extension.

Eventually you launch the update-ca-certificate command:

	/opt/csw/sbin/update-ca-certificates
