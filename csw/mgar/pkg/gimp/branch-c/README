Quickie notes for gimpq compilation.

basically, this should be "gimp_minimal"

note also: the configuration has that annoying 
 configure: error: GNU gettext tools not found; required for intltool

problem. so have to force /opt/csw/gnu first in PATH. which we do.


WARNING: Before releasing a "real" package of this,
  we have to split some stuffout of this beastie.
  like, "gimplibs"., which xsane uses.
  gimplibs is basically
  /opt/csw/include/.*
  /opt/csw/lib/lib.*
  /opt/csw/lib/pkgconfig/.*




DAAAAANG... the only gnomeish stuffs, is in the plugins? !?!?!  
  Original had:
  ./lib/gimp/2.0/plug-ins/helpbrowser
  ./lib/gimp/2.0/plug-ins/uri
  ./lib/gimp/2.0/plug-ins/svg

  (Debian separates out gnome-vfs plugin (which is "uri")

  oddly, new one seemed to have built helpbrowser WITHOUT gnome..??

  Separate out python plugins (not IN plugin dir, funnily enough)
     to gimp_python


SEPARATE (upstream) PACKAGES:
	gimp_help
	gimp_extras
	gimp_template
	gimpprint
