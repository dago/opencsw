DESCRIPTION = GNU zip
define BLURB
  gzip (GNU zip) is a compression utility designed to be a replacement for compress.
  Its main advantages over compress are much better compression and freedom from patented
  algorithms. It has been adopted by the GNU project and is now relatively popular on the
  Internet. gzip was written by Jean-loup Gailly (jloup@gzip.org), and Mark Adler for the
  decompression code.

# From TODO:
# - Add a block size (-b) option to improve error recovery in case of
#   failure of a complete sector. Each block could be extracted
#   independently, but this reduces the compression ratio.
# 
# For one possible approach to this, please see:
