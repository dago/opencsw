The original kshdb scripts were written by Bill Rosenblatt and published in
January 1993 by O'Reilly & Associates in the book "Learning the Korn Shell"
(ISBN: 1-56592-054-6).  These scripts were subsequently republished in the
May 1993 issue of UnixWorld Magazine.

The source code for these original scripts may be located at:

The author, Bill Rosenblatt, has indicated his willingness to allow the
kshdb code to be modified and redistributed, but the actual copyright is
owned by the publisher O'Reilly & Associates.  The complete text of the
"O'Reilly Policy on Re-Use of Code Examples from Books" can be seen at:

	http://www.oreilly.com/pub/a/oreilly/ask_tim/2001/codepolicy.html

In part, this policy states:

    "You can use and redistribute example code from our books for any
    non-commercial purpose (and most commercial purposes) as long as you
    acknowledge their source and authorship.  The source of the code should
    be noted in any documentation as well as in the program code itself
    (as a comment). The attribution should include author, title, publisher,
    and ISBN."

    "As per the copyright notice in our books, O'Reilly reserves all
    rights to the material in the book, including the code examples.  This
    literally means that you can use the example code all you like, but you
    can't publish or redistribute it without our permission.  In reality, we
    are comfortable with any reasonable "fair use" of the code, and you can
    assume permission is granted without contacting us."


The accompanying kshdbx scripts are modified versions of the original
kshdb scripts.  All modifications were written by C. Jeffery Small
(jeff@cjsa.com) and the right to use and redistribute these modifications
for any purpose is hereby granted, so long as a copy of this copyright file
always accompanies the code.
