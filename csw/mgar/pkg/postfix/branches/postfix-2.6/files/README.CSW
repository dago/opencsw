Replacing the system sendmail binaries
--------------------------------------
This package will not automatically substitute the common sendmail binaries
with links to the postfix binaries. Thus, the following files will be untouched
and possibly belong to the system sendmail installation.

  /usr/lib/sendmail
  /usr/bin/mailq
  /usr/bin/newaliases

This makes the package installation less troublesome for shared zones and
leaves the choice of fully replacing your system sendmail up to you. If you
intend to replace those binaries above with the ones from this postfix package,
there are two approaches (both currently _not_ supported in in shared zones):

#1: For testing purposes - allows for quick rollback, possibly harmful

This approach temporarily moves away the system sendmail binaries and replaces
them with links to the postfix binaries. This lets you test this postfix
package and easily roll back to the system sendmail in case you need to. It is
_not_ suited for long term operations as system sendmail patches will possibly
break those symlinks or worse, overwrite your postfix binaries with patched
sendmail versions.

Put in place:

  mv /usr/lib/sendmail /usr/lib/sendmail.SYSTEM
  mv /usr/bin/mailq /usr/bin/mailq.SYSTEM
  mv /usr/bin/newaliases /usr/bin/newaliases.SYSTEM
  
  ln -s /opt/csw/sbin/sendmail /usr/lib/sendmail
  ln -s /opt/csw/bin/newaliases /usr/bin/newaliases
  ln -s /opt/csw/bin/mailq /usr/bin/mailq

Roll back:

  rm /usr/lib/sendmail /usr/bin/newaliases /usr/bin/mailq
  mv /usr/lib/sendmail.SYSTEM /usr/lib/sendmail
  mv /usr/bin/mailq.SYSTEM /usr/bin/mailq
  mv /usr/bin/newaliases.SYSTEM /usr/bin/newaliases

#2: Recommended for production systems and long term operations

This approach fully removes the system sendmail packages and replaces the
binaries with links to the postfix binaries. Patches for the system sendmail
will be skipped and won't harm your setup. Keep your Solaris media available
in case you want to re-install the system sendmail packages.

Remove system sendmail:

  echo "rdepend=nocheck" > ~/admin-postfix
  echo "action=nocheck" >> ~/admin-postfix
  pkgrm -na ~/admin-postfix SUNWsndmr SUNWsndmu
  rm ~/admin-postfix

Depending on the speed of your system the pkgrm might take a while.

Put in place:

  ln -s /opt/csw/sbin/sendmail /usr/lib/sendmail
  ln -s /opt/csw/bin/newaliases /usr/bin/newaliases
  ln -s /opt/csw/bin/mailq /usr/bin/mailq

Roll back:

  echo "idepend=nocheck" > ~/admin-postfix
  echo "action=nocheck" >> ~/admin-postfix
  rm /usr/lib/sendmail /usr/bin/newaliases /usr/bin/mailq
  pkgadd -na ~/admin-postfix \
         -d <path_to_solaris_media>/Solaris_X/Products/ SUNWsndmr SUNWsndmu
  rm ~/admin-postfix

You might want to apply additional system sendmail patches that have been
released since the Solaris release from which you install those sendmail
packages.
