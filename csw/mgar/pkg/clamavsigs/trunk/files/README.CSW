==========
- You can find signature databases to download at http://sanesecurity.co.uk.

- You can adjust the time of the download to ease the load on the servers.
  Please do not use even hours since so many others already do, use a random
  minute every hour instead. DO NOT DOWNLOAD MORE THAN ONCE EVERY HOUR!

- You should probably set up log rotation.
