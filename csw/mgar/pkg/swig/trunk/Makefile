DESCRIPTION = A scripting interface generator for C/C++ code.
define BLURB
  SWIG is a software development tool that connects programs written in C and
  C++ with a variety of high-level programming languages. SWIG is primarily used
  with common scripting languages such as Perl, Python, Tcl/Tk, and Ruby,
  however the list of supported languages also includes non-scripting languages
  such as Java, OCAML and C#. Also several interpreted and compiled Scheme
  implementations (Guile, MzScheme, Chicken) are supported. SWIG is most
  commonly used to create high-level interpreted or compiled programming
  environments, user interfaces, and as a tool for testing and prototyping C/C++
  software. SWIG can also export its parse tree in the form of XML and Lisp
  s-expressions.
