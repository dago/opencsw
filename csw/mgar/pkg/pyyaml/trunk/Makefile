  PyYAML is a YAML parser and emitter for the Python programming language.

  PyYAML features:
  
  * a complete YAML 1.1 parser. In particular, PyYAML can parse all examples
    from the specification. The parsing algorithm is simple enough to be a
    reference for YAML parser implementors.
  * Unicode support including UTF-8/UTF-16 input/output and \u escape
    sequences.
  * low-level event-based parser and emitter API (like SAX).
  * high-level API for serializing and deserializing native Python
    objects (like DOM or pickle).
  * support for all types from the YAML types repository. A
    simple extension API is provided.
  * both pure-Python and fast LibYAML-based parsers and
    emitters.
  * relatively sensible error messages.
