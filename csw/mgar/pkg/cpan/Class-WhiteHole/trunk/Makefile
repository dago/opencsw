DESCRIPTION = base class to treat unhandled method calls as errors
define BLURB
  Its possible to accidentally inherit an AUTOLOAD method. Often this will
  happen if a class somewhere in the chain uses AutoLoader or defines one of
  their own. This can lead to confusing error messages when method lookups
  fail.
