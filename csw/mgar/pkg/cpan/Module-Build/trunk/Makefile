DESCRIPTION = build and install Perl modules
define BLURB
  Module::Build is a system for building, testing, and installing Perl
  modules.  It is meant to be a replacement for ExtUtils::MakeMaker.
  Developers may alter the behavior of the module through subclassing in a
  much more straightforward way than with MakeMaker.
