DESCRIPTION = extension for generating and manipulating HTML calendar
define BLURB
  HTML::CalendarMonth is a subclass of HTML::ElementTable. See
  HTML::ElementTable(3) for how that class works, for it affects this module
  on many levels. Like HTML::ElementTable, HTML::CalendarMonth behaves as if
  it were an HTML::ElementSuper, which is a regular HTML::Element with methods
  added to easily manipulate the appearance of the HTML table containing the
  calendar.
