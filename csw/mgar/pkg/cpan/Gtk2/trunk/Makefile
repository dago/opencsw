DESCRIPTION = Perl interface to the 2.x series of the Gimp Toolkit library
define BLURB
  Perl bindings to the 2.x series of the Gtk+ widget set.  This module allows
  you to write graphical user interfaces in a perlish and object-oriented way,
  freeing you from the casting and memory management in C, yet remaining very
  close in spirit to original API.
