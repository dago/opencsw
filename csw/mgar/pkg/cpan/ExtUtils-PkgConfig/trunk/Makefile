DESCRIPTION = simplistic interface to pkg-config
define BLURB
  The pkg-config program retrieves information about installed libraries,
  usually for the purposes of compiling against and linking to them.
  ExtUtils::PkgConfig is a very simplistic interface to this utility, intended
  for use in the Makefile.PL of perl extensions which bind libraries that
  pkg-config knows. It is really just boilerplate code that you would've
  written yourself.
