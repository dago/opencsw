DESCRIPTION = add a moniker method to UNIVERSAL
define BLURB
  Class names in Perl often don't sound great when spoken, or look good when
  written in prose. For this reason, we tend to say things like "customer" or
  "basket" when we are referring to My::Site::User::Customer or
  My::Site::Shop::Basket. We thought it would be nice if our classes knew what
  we would prefer to call them.
