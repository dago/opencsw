DESCRIPTION = A set of modules for parsing and evaluating XPath statements
define BLURB
  This module aims to comply exactly to the XPath specification at
  http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath and yet allow extensions to be added in the form
  of functions. Modules such as XSLT and XPointer may need to do this as they
  support functionality beyond XPath.
