DESCRIPTION = Converts Perl XS code into C code
define BLURB
  ExtUtils::ParseXS will compile XS code into C code by embedding the
  constructs necessary to let C functions manipulate Perl values and creates
  the glue necessary to let Perl access those functions. The compiler uses
  typemaps to determine how to map C function parameters and variables to Perl
  values.
