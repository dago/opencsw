DESCRIPTION = Manage IO on many file handles
define BLURB
	IO::Multiplex is designed to take the effort out of managing multiple file handles.
	It is essentially a really fancy front end to the select system call.
	In addition to maintaining the select loop, it buffers all input and output to/from the file handles.
	It can also accept incoming connections on one or more listen sockets.
