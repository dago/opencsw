DESCRIPTION = Jabber Perl Library
define BLURB
  The Jabber Instant Messaging project is an Open Source project seeking
  to provide a complete cross protocol messaging solution.  The problem
  with current IM solutions is that they are all proprietary and cannot
  talk to each other.  Jabber seeks to get rid of those barriers by
  allowing a Jabber client to talk with an AOL user, or an IRC chat room,
  or any number of other programs.
