DESCRIPTION = XMPP Perl Library
define BLURB
  The Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) is an IETF standard
  that provides a complete cross protocol messaging solution.  The problem
  with current IM solutions is that they are all proprietary and cannot
  talk to each other.  XMPP seeks to get rid of those barriers.
