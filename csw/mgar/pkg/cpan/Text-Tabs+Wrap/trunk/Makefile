DESCRIPTION = Text wrapping and tab expansion.
define BLURB
  Text::Tabs does about what the unix utilities expand(1) and unexpand(1) do.
  Given a line with tabs in it, expand will replace the tabs with the
  appropriate number of spaces.  Text::Wrap::wrap() is a very simple paragraph
  formatter. It formats a single paragraph at a time by breaking lines at word
  boundaries.
