DESCRIPTION = Interact with TELNET port or other TCP ports
define BLURB
  Net::Telnet allows you to make client connections to a TCP port and do
  network I/O, especially to a port using the TELNET protocol. Simple I/O
  methods such as print, get, and getline are provided. More sophisticated
  interactive features are provided because connecting to a TELNET port
  ultimately means communicating with a program designed for human
  interaction. These interactive features include the ability to specify a
  time-out and to wait for patterns to appear in the input stream, such as
  the prompt from a shell.
