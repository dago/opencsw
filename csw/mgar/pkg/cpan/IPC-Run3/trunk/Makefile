DESCRIPTION = Run a subprocess with input/ouput redirection
define BLURB
  This module allows you to run a subprocess and redirect stdin, stdout,
  and/or stderr to files and perl data structures. It aims to satisfy 99% of
  the need for using system()/qx``/open3() with a simple, extremely Perlish
  API and none of the bloat and rarely used features of IPC::Run.
