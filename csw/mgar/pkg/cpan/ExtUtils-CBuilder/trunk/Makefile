DESCRIPTION = Compile and link C code for Perl modules
define BLURB
  This module can build the C portions of Perl modules by invoking the
  appropriate compilers and linkers in a cross-platform manner. It was
  motivated by the Module::Build project, but may be useful for other purposes
  as well.  However, it is not intended as a general cross-platform interface
  to all your C building needs. That would have been a much more ambitious
  goal!
