DESCRIPTION = Attempt to recover from people calling UNIVERSAL::isa as a function
define BLURB
  Whenever you use "isa" in UNIVERSAL as a function, a kitten using 
  Test::MockObject dies. Normally, the kittens would be helpless, but 
  if they use UNIVERSAL::isa (the module whose docs you are reading), 
  the kittens can live long and prosper.
  This module replaces UNIVERSAL::isa with a version that makes sure that, 
  when called as a function on objects which override isa, isa will 
  call the appropriate method on those objects
  In all other cases, the real UNIVERSAL::isa gets called directly.
