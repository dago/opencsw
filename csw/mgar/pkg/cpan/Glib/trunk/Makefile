DESCRIPTION = wrappers for the GLib utility and Object libraries
define BLURB
  This module provides perl access to GLib and GLib's GObject libraries. GLib
  is a portability and utility library; GObject provides a generic type system
  with inheritance and a powerful signal system. Together these libraries are
  used as the foundation for many of the libraries that make up the Gnome
  environment, and are used in many unrelated projects.
