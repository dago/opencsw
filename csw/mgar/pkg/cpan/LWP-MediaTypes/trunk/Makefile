DESCRIPTION = Guess media type for a file or a URL
define BLURB
  This module provides functions for handling media (also known as MIME) types
  and encodings. The mapping from file extensions to media types is defined by
  the media.types file. If the ~/.media.types file exists it is used instead.
  For backwards compatibility we will also look for ~/.mime.types.
