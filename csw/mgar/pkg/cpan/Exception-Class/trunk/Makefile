DESCRIPTION = Declare real exception classes in Perl
define BLURB
  Exception::Class allows you to declare exception hierarchies in your modules
  in a "Java-esque" manner.  It features a simple interface allowing
  programmers to 'declare' exception classes at compile time. It also has a
  base exception class, Exception::Class::Base, that can be easily extended.
