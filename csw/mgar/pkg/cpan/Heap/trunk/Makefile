DESCRIPTION = Extensions for keeping data partially sorted

  The Heap collection of modules provide routines that manage a heap of
  elements.  A heap is a partially sorted structure that is always able to
  easily extract the smallest of the elements in the structure (or the largest
  if a reversed compare routine is provided).
