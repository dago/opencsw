DESCRIPTION = SSL support for Net::SMTP
define BLURB

Implements the same API as Net::SMTP, but uses IO::Socket::SSL for its
network operations. Due to the nature of "Net::SMTP"'s "new" method, it
is not overridden to make use of a default port for the SMTPS service.
Perhaps future versions will be smart like that. Port 465 is usually
what you want, and it's not a pain to specify that. 
For interface documentation, please see Net::SMTP.
