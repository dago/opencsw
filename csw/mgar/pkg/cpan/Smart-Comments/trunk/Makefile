DESCRIPTION = Smart::Comments - Comments that do more than just sit there
define BLURB
	Smart comments provide an easy way to insert debugging and tracking code into a
	program. They can report the value of a variable, track the progress of a loop,
	and verify that particular assertions are true.

	Best of all, when you're finished debugging, you don't have to remove them.
	Simply commenting out the use Smart::Comments line turns them back into regular
	comments. Leaving smart comments in your code is smart because if you needed
	them once, you'll almost certainly need them again later.
