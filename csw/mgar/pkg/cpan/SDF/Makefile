define BLURB
  SDF (Simple Document Format) is a freely available document development
  system which generates high quality outputs in a variety of formats
  from a single source. The output formats supported include
  PostScript(tm), PDF, HTML, plain text, POD, man pages, LaTeX,
  MIF, SGML, Windows(tm) help, RTF, MIMS F6 help and MIMS HTX help.
  If the idea of specifying documents in a logical manner via a
  simple markup language sounds appealing, SDF may be useful to you.
