DESCRIPTION = Provides basic first-pass API testing for large class trees
define BLURB
  For many APIs with large numbers of classes, it can be very useful to be
  able to do a quick once-over to make sure that classes, methods, and
  inheritance is correct, before doing more comprehensive testing. This
  module aims to provide such a capability.
