DESCRIPTION = add contextual fetches to DBI
define BLURB
  It always struck me odd that DBI didn't take much advantage of Perl's
  context sensitivity. DBIx::ContextualFetch redefines some of the various
  fetch methods to fix this oversight. It also adds a few new methods for
  convenience (though not necessarily efficiency).
