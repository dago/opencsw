MySQL 5.5 OpenCSW package
=======================

* Read only /opt/csw support
  - data in /var/opt/csw
  - configuration in /etc/opt/csw
* The prefix is /opt/csw, and all the binaries are now in
  /opt/csw, so that the standard PATH setting allows to use them
* The startup script is now in /etc/opt/csw/init.d
* SMF support is handled by cswclassutils
