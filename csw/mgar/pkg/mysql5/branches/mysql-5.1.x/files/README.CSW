MySQL 5.1 OpenCSW package
=======================

* http://www.opencsw.org/packages/mysql51

The package has been reworked from the ground up, using GAR.  Up until this
moment, the mysql5 package was in the version from before the fork.  The new
packages are created so that they are as close to the original ones as
possible, but some changes are inevitable, and some other changes were
considered necessary.

* Read only /opt/csw support
  - data in /var/opt/csw
  - configuration in /etc/opt/csw
* The prefix is still /opt/csw/mysql51, but all the binaries are now linked from
  /opt/csw, so that the standard PATH setting allows to use them
* The startup script is now in /etc/opt/csw/init.d
* SMF support is handled by cswclassutils


Here are the old notes from the previous maintainer, Alex Moore:

--------------8<----------------8<--------------------8<------------------------

If you are not using the default location for --datadir, package installation
  will NOT start CSWmysql5.  More code is needed for that.  I welcome patches.

If you are not using the default location for --datadir, you will find
  that CSWmysql5 works much better when you create /etc/my.cnf with at
  least the entries that follow.  You may also want some entries in this
  global options file for client programs that you use.
  For example: --datadir is /db/mysql5/var
  Create /etc/my.cnf with the following entries:
    # Global MySQL options file.
    [mysqld]
    datadir         = /db/mysql5/var
    basedir         = /opt/csw/mysql5

I also changed the option for --defaults-file to --defaults-extra-file
  in the startup script.
  This allows your options file to be read after the global options file
  /etc/my.cnf.

Note that if you are using the default location for --datadir, you do not
  really need /etc/opt/csw/mysql5rc.  In this case, you should put any options
  in the appropriate group in my.cnf.  See the MySQL documentation for
  details.

If you are not using the default location for --datadir, you only need
  /etc/opt/csw/mysql5rc for the startup script options for
  --defaults-extra-file and possibly --pid-file.  All other options may be
  put in the appropriate group in my.cnf
