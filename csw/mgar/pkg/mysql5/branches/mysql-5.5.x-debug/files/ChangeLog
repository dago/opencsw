	* Makefile: Reworked the package from ground up, using GAR.

	* Version 5.1: MySQL 5.1 is still in beta.  This package is released
	for your testing only.

	* Startup script: This update fixes a startup script problem that
	caused the script to not work when --datadir is not the default.  This
	update also adds amd64 mysqld and client libraries.

	* csw.conf: This update adds support for csw.conf.  See the following
	url for details.  http://www.blastwave.org/standards/csw.conf.html The
	daemon specific name for this package is mysql5.
	*** IMPORTANT ***
	If you are using mysql5rc; please move your options to my.cnf and
	eliminate mysql5rc.  A future release will remove mysql5rc.  my.cnf is
	more flexible and any new or missing options will not be added to
	mysql5rc.  quick_start-csw is changed with this release to Not write
	mysql5rc.  Options for --basedir and --datadir are included in the
	default my.cnf files.
	*** END OF IMPORTANT ***

	* quick_start-csw: This update fixes some problems with
	quick_start-csw and svc-mysql5.  I have also corrected some issues
	when using a database directory that is not /opt/csw/mysql5/var If you
	are not using the default location for --datadir, package installation
	will NOT start CSWmysql5.  More code is needed for that.  I welcome
	patches.
