DESCRIPTION = a cataloging system for documentation on open systems
define BLURB
 ScrollKeeper is a cataloging system for documentation on open systems. It
 manages documentation metadata (as specified by the Open Source Metadata
 Framework(OMF)) and provides a simple API to allow help browsers to find,
 sort, and search the document catalog. It will also be able to communicate
 with catalog servers on the Net to search for documents which are not on the
 local system.
