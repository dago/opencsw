To configure the Apache webserver you only need to include the file
/etc/opt/csw/munin/apache/apache-munin.conf into your Apache main
configuration:

Include /etc/opt/csw/munin/apache/apache-munin.conf

If you want CGI support for Munin, include the file apache-munin-cgi.conf:

Include /etc/opt/csw/munin/apache/apache-munin-cgi.conf
