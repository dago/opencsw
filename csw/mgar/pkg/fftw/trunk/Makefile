DESCRIPTION = Library for computing the discrete Fourier transform (DFT)
define BLURB
  FFTW is a C subroutine library for computing the discrete Fourier transform (DFT)
  in one or more dimensions, of arbitrary input size, and of both real and complex
  data (as well as of even/odd data, i.e. the discrete cosine/sine transforms or
  DCT/DST). We believe that FFTW, which is free software, should become the FFT
  library of choice for most applications.
