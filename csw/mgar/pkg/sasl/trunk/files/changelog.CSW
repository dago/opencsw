sasl (2.1.22,REV=2007.06.10)

  * sasl updated to 2.1.22

  * runpath was not applied for libraries [#1566][#1637][#1934][#2268]

  * saslauthd: sasl was built with invalid list of search directories for
    libraries [#2103]

  * saslauthd: man page was in postscript format [#2261]


sasl (2.1.21,REV=2006.03.09)

  * /opt/csw/etc/sasldb2 is a directory [#1393]

  * preinstall script is using PKG_INSTALL_ROOT variable instead of
    PKG_ROOT_DIR

  * saslauthd: Communication with SASL is done with unix sockets because ipc
    doors mechanism is unreliable [#1222] [#1225] [#1227]

  * sasluthd: Authentification mechanism should be configureable without editing
    init.d script [#1221]

  * saslauthd: postinstall script is using PKG_INSTALL_ROOT variable instead of
    PKG_ROOT_DIR


sasl (2.1.21,REV=2005.09.07)

  * upgraded to version 2.1.21

  * included unsupported LOGIN SASL mechanism, because I received
    several requests for this mechanism. Some mail clients (e.g. MS
    Outlook) only support LOGIN mechanism.

  * included auxprop plugins for MySQL, PostreSQL and SQLLite

  * included kerberos mechanisms (GSSAPI)

  * CSWsasl creates a group 'sasl'. Any process which is not running
    as root, must belong to this group to perform authentiaction
    against SASLdb or via saslauthd.

  * saslauthd: /etc/init.d/CSWsaslauthd renamed to /etc/init.d/cswsaslauthd to be
    consistent with other blastwave packages
