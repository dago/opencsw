sasl README
-----------

 * The location of `sasldb2' has been moved from /opt/csw/etc to
   /etc/opt/csw.

 * SASL application configuration files (e.g. Sendmail.conf) go into
   /opt/csw/lib/sasl2 or /opt/csw/lib/64/sasl2 for 64-bit binaries.

 * CSWsasl creates a group 'sasl'. Any process which is not running as root,
   must belong to this group to perform authentication against SASLdb or via saslauthd.
