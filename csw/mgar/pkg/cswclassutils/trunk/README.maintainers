Fellow maintainers:

cswclassutils is now a shell package for several subpackages that
primarily consist of nothing more than a single i, r CAS pair.  The
GAR recipe is setup such that all you normally need to do to add a new
CAS is to add the scripts to the files/ directory, following the
naming convention CSWcswclassutils.[ir].csw$name (eg:
CSWcswclassutils.i.cswpycompile).

To release an update of a script pair that you tend, do:

1. Update the script(s) appropriately.
2. Bump the version number in Makefile
3. Commit changes to svn.
4. gmake package-CSWcas-$name (eg: package-CSWcas-initsmf)

All of the GAR stuff is dynamically generated.  You can override these
values if desired, but in most cases this won't be required.

You should get a package file with a filename like:

cas_$name-X.Y.Z,REV=%Y.%m.%d...

Ask on the list if you have any questions about this..

Thanks
-Ben
