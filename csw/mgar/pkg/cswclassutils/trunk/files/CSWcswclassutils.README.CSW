CSWcswclassutils
================

This package contains class action scripts to simplify doing common tasks in a
consistent manner. They can also be updated to benefit all packages that make
use of them.

Currently it has:

- cswinitsmf

  This class takes care of creating/removing init script links for Solaris 8
  and 9. For Solaris 10+ it supports SMF and can create a simple manifest on
  the fly at installation time. Read more about how to use it in the sample
  init script provided in /etc/opt/csw/init.d/csw.smf.sample.

- cswcpsampleconf

  This script handles the sample configuration files. If you provide a file
  called cswfoo.CSW it will copy it to cswfoo it that file doesn't already
  exist. Read more in /usr/sadm/install/scripts/i.cswcpsampleconf and
  r.cswcpsampleconf.

- cswpreserveconf

  This is an enhanced variation of cswcpsampleconf. It moves
  user-modified versions of the sample config files, to a preserve
  directory when a package is removed, and restores it on the next pkgadd.
  Read more in /usr/sadm/install/scripts/i.cswpreserveconf and
  r.cswpreserveconf.

- cswusergroup

  This class creates users and/or groups needed for packages. It supports
  users, groups, gcos, home directory and shell. You can also decide if you want
  the home directories to be created and/or removed during install/remove.

- cswpycompile

  This class takes care of creating/removing python's normal and optimized
  bytecode files.  Set all *.py files' class = cswpycompile to activate.

  In GAR, set the variable PYCOMPILE = 1 to activate.

- cswinetdconf

  This class manipulates /etc/inetd.conf (solaris 8/9) or enables an
  inetd service in smf (solaris 10+).

- cswetcservices

  This class takes care of registering services in the global
  /etc/services file.  It is a one way manipulation.  At package
  removal, the service entries are left behind.

- cswtexinfo

  This class takes care of keeping the info/dir page of CSWtexinfo
  in sync with all texinfo pages installed. It adds entries on
  package installation and removes them on package removal.

- cswcrontab

  This class allows adding entries to the crontab for arbitrary users.
  The entries will be tagged with the package name and removed on
  package removal. If the entries have been changed manually they will
  not be preserved.

- cswtexhash

  This class takes care of keeping the Tex packages index in sync with
  all TeX packages installed. It adds index entries on package
  installation and removes them on package removal.

- cswdictconf

  This class takes care of keeping the dictionaries used by the DICT
  server in sync with all the dictionary packages installed. It add
  entries in the servers configuration on package installation and
  removes them on package removal.
