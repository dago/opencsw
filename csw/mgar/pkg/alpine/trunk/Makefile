define BLURB
	Alpine is a fast, easy to use email client that is suitable for both 
	the inexperienced email user as well as for the most demanding of power 
	users. Alpine is based on the PineÂ® Message System, which was also
   	developed at the University of Washington. Alpine can be learned by 
	exploration and the use of context-sensitive help. The user experience 
	is highly customizable through the use of the Alpine Setup command.
