DESCRIPTION = A YAML mode for Emacs
define BLURB
This is a major mode for editing files in the YAML data
serialization format.  It was initially developed by Yoshiki
Kurihara and many features were added by Marshall Vandegrift.  As
YAML and Python share the fact that indentation determines
structure, this mode provides indentation and indentation command
behavior very similar to that of python-mode.
