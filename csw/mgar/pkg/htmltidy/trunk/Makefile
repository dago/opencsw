DESCRIPTION = Cleans up HTML source and formats it nicely.
define BLURB
  HTML TIDY is a free utility to fix mistakes made while editing HTML and to
  automatically tidy up sloppy editing into nicely layed out markup. It also
  works great on the atrociously hard to read markup generated by specialized
  HTML editors and conversion tools, and can help you identify where you need to
  pay further attention on making your pages more accessible to people with
  disabilities.
