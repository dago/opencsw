define BLURB
  GUI tools should not mislead the user; they should display the current
  state of the system, even when changes to the system originate from outside
  of the tools themselves. FAM helps make GUI tools more usable by notifying
  them when the files they're interested in are created, modified, executed,
  and removed.
