DESCRIPTION = Lightweight command-line download accelerator
define BLURB
  Axel tries to accelerate downloads by using multiple connections (possibly 
  to multiple servers) for one download. Because of its size, it might be 
  very useful on bootdisks or other small systems as a wget replacement

# Beware: When bumping the version, you also need to visit the download page
# and get the correct DOWNLOAD_ID for the new version. If you don't change it,
# you will get the tarball with the corrent name, but with the old content.
