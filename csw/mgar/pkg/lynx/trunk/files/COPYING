   Lynx is distributed under the GNU General Public License (GPL) without
   restrictions on usage or redistribution.  The Lynx copyright statement,
   "COPYHEADER", and GNU GPL, "COPYING", are included in the top-level
   directory of the distribution.  Lynx is supported by the Lynx user
   community, an entirely volunteer (and unofficial) organization.

   Certain portions of the Lynx source distribution were originally
   created by CERN and have been modified during the development of
   Lynx.  See WWW/FreeofCharge.html for copyright info regarding CERN
   products used in Lynx.

   Note that Lynx is not self-contained; typically it is built with a
   variety of add-on libraries, including those for compression, IPv6,
   SOCKS and SSL support.
