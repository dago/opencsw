DESCRIPTION = implementation of an e-component of network intrusion detection
define BLURB
 Libnids is a library that provides a functionality of one of NIDS 
 (Network Intrusion Detection System) components, namely E-component. It means 
 that libnids code watches all local network traffic, cooks received datagrams 
 a bit (quite a bit ;)), and provides convenient information on them to 
 analyzing modules of NIDS.
