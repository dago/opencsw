DESCRIPTION = a collection of tools for network auditing and penetration testing
define BLURB
  dsniff is a collection of tools for network auditing and penetration testing.
	dsniff, filesnarf, mailsnarf, msgsnarf, urlsnarf, and webspy passively monitor
	a network for interesting data (passwords, e-mail, files, etc.). arpspoof,
	dnsspoof, and macof facilitate the interception of network traffic normally
	unavailable to an attacker (e.g, due to layer-2 switching). sshmitm and
	webmitm implement active monkey-in-the-middle attacks against redirected SSH
	and HTTPS sessions by exploiting weak bindings in ad-hoc PKI.
