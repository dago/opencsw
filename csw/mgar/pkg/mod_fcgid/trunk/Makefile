DESCRIPTION = FastCGI module with fine grained process spawn/lifetime control
define BLURB
  mod_fcgid is a high performance alternative to mod_cgi or mod_cgid,
  which starts a sufficient number instances of the CGI program to handle
  concurrent requests, and these programs remain running to handle further
  incoming requests. It is favored by the PHP developers, for example, as
  a preferred alternative to running mod_php in-process, delivering very
  similar performance.
