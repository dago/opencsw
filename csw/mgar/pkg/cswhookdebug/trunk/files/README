This small package adds debugging capabilities to the hook caller (eg:
the package tool).  It does nothing other than echo the hook name and
the arguments passed to stdout (with ansi colours to make them easily
visible).

The package hook requirements are detailed here:
http://wiki.opencsw.org/package-hooks

Currently, this is only implemented in pkgutil v1.7 or later.
