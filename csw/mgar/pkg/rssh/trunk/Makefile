DESCRIPTION = A restricted shell for use with OpenSSH
define BLURB
  rssh is a restricted shell for use with OpenSSH, allowing only scp and/or sftp.
  It now also includes support for rdist, rsync, and cvs. For example, if you have
  a server which you only want to allow users to copy files off of via scp, without
  providing shell access, you can use rssh to do that. For a list of platforms on
  which rssh is known to work, see the Platform Support Page.
