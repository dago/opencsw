The description below is for manual installation, the inetd configuration
should now be handled automatically.

# qpopper pop3 server
pop3    stream  tcp     nowait  root    /opt/csw/sbin/popper    popper -s

2. Reload inetd:

# pkill -HUP inetd

3. Test with:

# telnet localhost pop3	(pop3/110 should already be in /etc/services)
Trying 127.0.0.1...
