DESCRIPTION = lighttpd - Security, speed, compliance, and flexibility http server
define BLURB
  Security, speed, compliance, and flexibility -- all of these describe lighttpd
  (pron. lighty) which is rapidly redefining efficiency of a webserver; as it is
  designed and optimized for high performance environments. With a small memory
  footprint compared to other web-servers, effective management of the cpu-load,
  and advanced feature set (FastCGI, SCGI, Auth, Output-Compression,
  URL-Rewriting and many more) lighttpd is the perfect solution for every server
  that is suffering load problems. And best of all it's Open Source licensed
  under the revised BSD license.
