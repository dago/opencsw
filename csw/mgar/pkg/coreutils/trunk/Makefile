DESCRIPTION = GNU core utilities
define BLURB
The GNU Core Utilities are the basic file, shell and text manipulation utilities of the GNU operating system. These are the core utilities which are expected to exist on every operating system.

Previously these utilities were offered as three individual sets of GNU utilities, Fileutils, Shellutils, and Textutils. Those three have been combined into a single set of utilities called Coreutils.
