DESCRIPTION = Python parsing module
define BLURB
  The pyparsing module is an alternative approach to creating and executing
  simple grammars, vs. the traditional lex/yacc approach, or the use of regular
  expressions. The pyparsing module provides a library of classes that client
  code uses to construct the grammar directly in Python code.
