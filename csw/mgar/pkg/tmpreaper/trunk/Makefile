DESCRIPTION = Cleans up files in directories based on their age
define BLURB
  This package provides a program that can be used to clean out
  temporary-file directories. It recursively searches the directory,
  refusing to chdir() across symlinks, and removes files that haven't been
  accessed in a user-specified amount of time. You can specify a set of
  files to protect from deletion with a shell pattern. It will not remove
  files owned by the process EUID that have the `w' bit clear, unless you
  ask it to, much like `rm -f'. `tmpreaper' will not remove symlinks,
  sockets, fifos, or special files unless given a command line option
  enabling it to.
