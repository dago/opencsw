070713. DBI is required (for SA cache?), but is listed as optional.
070711. What is clamd looking for in virus.scanners.conf? /bin/false for path?
070711. Syslogging shows localhost instead of actual hostname.

Fixed
=====
080409. Bug in update_bad_phishing_sites, logs as update.phishing.sites. FIX:
        rewritten in Perl in 4.68.
070815. Date::Parse (TimeDate) is required. Not listed with -v. FIX: fixed in
        4.64.3.
070816. check_mailscanner should use pgrep instead of complicated 4-line
        grep that fails if path does not contain MailScanner. FIX: fixed in
        4.63.8.
070711. Why is a new incoming pid-dir created for a --lint? Or more importantly,
        why is it not removed after the lint is finished? FIX: seems OK in 4.62.
070711. MailScanner.pid left in /opt/csw/mailscanner, should be written to
        /opt/csw/mailscanner/var. FIX: path in cswmailscanner (start script in
        init.d) fixed.
