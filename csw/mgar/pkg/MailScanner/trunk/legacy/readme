Todo
----
# if csw.conf is enabled, try to get up and running immediately
# - stop/disable sun sendmail and csw sendmail (note: smf on sol10)
# - start cswmailscanner.sendmail and cswmailscanner
# -- maybe not such a good idea after upgrades?
# -- stop/disable can be done but start?

Build script
------------
- menu based
+ fix ownership/permissions
+ add csw-directory
+ ask for version
+ add pstamp
+ create prototype
+ pkgmk
+ pkgtrans
+ gzip
+ copy to testing

Misc
----
+ Add CSW specific things (start scripts...) in csw-directory
+ Add CSW readme, history and so on in csw-directory
+ SMF support

Postinstall
----------
+ symlink /opt/MailScanner to /opt/csw/mailscanner
++ detect if link already present
- ask if to disable CSWsendmail/SUNWsendmail (rename init.d file or remove K/S
  symlinks?)
+ install start script (cswmailscanner) with K/S symlinks
- start script should support general MTA operation (start/stop)
+ start script should support Sendmail
- ask for queue folders (default: /var/spool)
+ create queue folders and MailScanner folder
+ support S10 svc feature
+ copy .CSW config files to non .CSW

Postremove
----------
+ remove symlink /opt/MailScanner
+ diff config files against originals, if modified copy to other name
++ should package only contain config files named x.CSW to avoid above issue?
+++ yes!

Modifications
-------------
+ #!/usr/bin/perl -> #!/opt/csw/bin/perl
- /opt in bin/MailScanner
- /var in bin/update_virus_scanners
- /etc in bin/cron/check_MailScanner.cron
          bin/cron/update_phishing_sites.cron
