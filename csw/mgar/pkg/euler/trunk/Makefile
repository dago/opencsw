define BLURB
  This is the GTK+ based version of EULER for Unix / Linux systems. It has been ported
  to GTK+ by Eric Bouchar√© (bouchare dot eric at wanadoo dot fr) on the base of Dr Ren
  Grothmann's X11 version. Euler was started by Dr Grothmann. He also maintains a version
  for Windows systems.

  EULER is a program for quickly and interactively computing with real and complex
  numbers and matrices, or with intervals, in the style of MatLab, Octave,...
  It can draw and animate your functions in two and three dimensions.
