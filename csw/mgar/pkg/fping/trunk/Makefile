DESCRIPTION = A ping like program accepting any number of hosts
define BLURB
  fping is a ping(1) like program which uses the Internet Control
  Message Protocol (ICMP) echo request to determine if a host is up.
  fping is different from ping in that you can specify any number of
  hosts on the command line, or specify a file containing the lists
  of hosts to ping. Instead of trying one host until it timeouts or
  replies, fping will send out a ping packet and move on to the next
  host in a round-robin fashion. If a host replies, it is noted and
  removed from the list of hosts to check. If a host does not respond
  within a certain time limit and/or retry limit it will be considered
  unreachable.
