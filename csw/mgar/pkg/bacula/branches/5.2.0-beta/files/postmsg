This package relies on several components sharing several password
values.  As the components will be installed on multiple machines,
there is no point in changing the default values as we could not make
the same change on all systems without using a similarly well-known
default value.

You are urged to change all Password values in the files:
/etc/opt/csw/bacula/bacula-dir.conf
/etc/opt/csw/bacula/bacula-fd.conf
/etc/opt/csw/bacula/bacula-sd.conf
/etc/opt/csw/bacula/bconsole.conf

This should be done on all nodes running any or all of:
CSWbacula-director
CSWbacula-sd
CSWbacula-fd
CSWbacula-console
