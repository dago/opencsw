DESCRIPTION = C language source code formatting program 
define BLURB
  The indent program can be used to make code easier to read. It can also convert
  from one style of writing C to another. indent understands a substantial amount
  about the syntax of C, but it also attempts to cope with incomplete and
  misformed syntax.
