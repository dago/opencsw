Our build of GNU tar does not include the GNU "rmt" program. That is a part
of our gcpio package. If you wish to use GNU rmt, please install
our gcpio package, and GNU tar should automatically make use of it.

If you wish to use the Solaris rmt, you could try 
ln -s /usr/sbin/rmt /opt/csw/libexec/grmt
