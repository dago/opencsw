DESCRIPTION = A garbage collector for C and C++
define BLURB
	The Boehm-Demers-Weiser conservative garbage collector can be used as a
	garbage collecting replacement for C malloc or C++ new. It allows you to
	allocate memory basically as you normally would, without explicitly
	deallocating memory that is no longer useful. The collector automatically
	recycles memory when it determines that it can no longer be otherwise
	accessed.
