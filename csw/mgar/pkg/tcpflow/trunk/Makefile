DESCRIPTION = A TCP Flow Recorder
define BLURB
  tcpflow is a program that captures data transmitted as part of TCP 
  connections (flows), and stores the data in a way that is convenient 
  for protocol analysis or debugging. A program like 'tcpdump' shows a 
  summary of packets seen on the wire, but usually doesn't store the data 
  that's actually being transmitted. In contrast, tcpflow reconstructs 
  the actual data streams and stores each flow in a separate file for 
  later analysis.
