DESCRIPTION = Utility for writing fast and flexible scanners.
define BLURB
   re2c is a tool for writing very fast and very flexible scanners. 
   Unlike any other such tool, re2c focuses on generating high efficient 
   code for regular expression matching. As a result this allows a much 
   broader range of use than any traditional lexer offers. 
   And Last but not least re2c generates warning free code that is equal 
   to hand-written code in terms of size, speed and quality.
