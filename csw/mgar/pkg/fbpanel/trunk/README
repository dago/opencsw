fbpanel notes:

first off.. THIS IS NOT OFFICIALLY RELEASED YET.
 But I'm keeping my work in svn
 (and a package in experimental)

it has a few problems. Problems first, Notes, lower down.

PROBLEMS:


*. It uses /usr/share/icons/hicolor/*  as its icons path
   So that means it technically depends on 
   SUNWgnome-themes-share
   We COULD get it to depend on CSWxfceiconthemes.
   But better to get our own full independant sharable iconthemes package
  eg: debian hicolor-icon-theme
    Which is from FreeDesktop.org icon themes
  Wait we ALREADY HAVE THAT, yay!
  But.. it.. has.. no icons in it??!?!?

  use gnome_icon_theme instead? nope...
  CSWgnomethemes

  THen need to set theme_engine or something...



*. Need to FIX PLUGINS!! (net, cpu, mem)
 (which requires porting. See patches to xfce_systemtray for
  that sort of thing)


NOTES:

*.  configuration is WEEERID.and very nonportable.
  takes GNU autoconf,and makes it dumber.
  It breaks gmake MFLAGS=-j, among other things.

*.   Have to have /opt/csw/gnu first in path.. fixed in makefile

*. have to run configure with bash.
   its already #!/bin/bash but that dont work?!?!?

*.   It has some kind of WEIIIIERD "rfs-scripts-xxxx" wrappers
     aroung things like pkg-config. Arrg.
     And it does it by hacking configure, to do
     "source scripts/custom.sh"

     Now provide own custom.sh
