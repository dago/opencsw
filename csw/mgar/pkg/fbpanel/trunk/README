fbpanel notes:

first off.. THIS IS NOT OFFICIALLY RELEASED YET.
 But I'm keeping my work in svn
 (and a package in experimental)

0.  configuration is WEEERID.and very nonportable.
  takes GNU autoconf,and makes it dumber.
  It breaks gmake MFLAGS=-j, among other things.

1.   Have to have /opt/csw/gnu first in path.

2. have to run configure with bash -x.
   its already #!/bin/bash but that dont work?!?!?

3. CC=gcc. its just got too many gnuisms.

4. need to set cpu type in there somehow too...

5. It uses /usr/share/icons/hicolor/*  as its icons path
   So that means it technically depends on 
   SUNWgnome-themes-share
   We COULD get it to depend on CSWxfceiconthemes.
   But better to get our own full independant sharable iconthemes package
  eg: debian hicolor-icon-theme
    Which is from FreeDesktop.org icon themes
  Wait we ALREADY HAVE THAT, yay!
  But.. it.. has.. no icons in it??!?!?

  use gnome_icon_theme instead? nope...
  CSWgnomethemes

  THen need to set theme_engine or something...

   gtk_icon_theme_load_icon() is at fault




 6. Need to FIX PLUGINS!! (net, cpu, mem)
