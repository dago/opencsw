define BLURB
  This is the library needed to YTNEF application.
  This program decodes those annoying application/ms-tnef MIME attachments that
  Microsoft mail servers helpfully use to encapsulate your already MIME encoded
  attachments.
  The YTNEF program allows one to unpack the attachments which were encapsulated
  into the YTNEF attachment.  Thus alleviating the need to use Microsoft Outlook
  to view them.
