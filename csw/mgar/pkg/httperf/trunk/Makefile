DESCRIPTION = A tool for measuring web server performance.
define BLURB
  Httperf is a tool for measuring web server performance. It provides a
  flexible facility for generating various HTTP workloads and for
  measuring server performance.
  
  The focus of httperf is not on implementing one particular benchmark but
  on providing a robust, high-performance tool that facilitates the
  construction of both micro- and macro-level benchmarks. The three
  distinguishing characteristics of httperf are its robustness, which
  includes the ability to generate and sustain server overload, support
  for the HTTP/1.1 and SSL protocols, and its extensibility to new
  workload generators and performance measurements.
