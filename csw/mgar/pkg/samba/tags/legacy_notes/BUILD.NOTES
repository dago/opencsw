INSTRUCTIONS (reasons for it lower down)

# edit source/Makefile and change SHELL to /bin/bash
# patch <~/pkgs/samba/Makefile.patch

cd packaging/Solaris
patch <~/pkgs/samba/makepkg.sh.diff

# tweak pkginfo.master as desired, for test package
bash ./makepkg.sh build

You should then manually KILL IT, when it starts the compile phase.
 Then cd ../../source, and edit out -z text from Makefile, and
 do a make.

 (Where does it come from!?!? It's not in Makefile.in ?!!)
 	- This is leaked in from a call to `krb5-config --libs`

PROBLEMS:

bombs out  after loong time, with error under
 source/lib/ldb with <undefined> reference or something
  from ldb_module.o

both gcc and cc die.
Apparently, it's because samba does "bad things" with 
reallocation of what should be read-only code in shared libs.
This makes it 'inefficient', by itself.
  Unfortunately,"-z text" makes it a fatal flaw.. so, have to
   manually remove that flag from Makefile, after configure!!

Additionally, need to change SHELL=/bin/sh to SHELL=bin/bash in Makefile

LD_OPTIONS='-R/opt/csw/lib/$ISALIST -R$ORIGIN/../lib -R/opt/csw/lib -L/opt/csw/lib'


TO PACKAGE UP THEIR WAY:
Need to patch paths, and use
packaging/Solaris/makepkg.sh.csw

Which also has to hack LD_LIBRARY_PATH because they script does naughty things

plus, errors in final packaging:

    no object for <lib/libsmbclient.a> found in root directory
    no object for <lib/libmsrpc.so> found in root directory
    no object for <lib/libmsrpc.a> found in root directory
    no object for <include/libmsrpc.h> found in root directory
    no object for <docs/*pdf> found in root directory
# libsmbclient libmsrpc

Late note: patch the sample smb.conf.default to have /var/opt
instead of /usr/local/samba/var reference
