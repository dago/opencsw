VERSION = 0.20

CATEGORIES = apps
DESCRIPTION = A utility for automated configuration of GNU autotools
define BLURB

  autoproject interviews the user, then creates a source package for a new
  program which follows the GNU programming standards. The new package uses
  autoconf to configure itself, and automake to create the Makefile. `make
  distcheck' succeeds.

  The idea is that you execute autoproject just once when you start a new
  project. It will ask a few questions, then create a new directory and populate
  it with standard files, customized for the new project.
