DESCRIPTION = Open-source software for intra-institutional web authentication
define BLURB
  Pubcookie consists of a standalone login server and modules
  for common web server platforms like Apache and Microsoft IIS.
  Together, these components can turn existing authentication
  services (like Kerberos, LDAP, or NIS) into a solution for
  single sign-on authentication to websites throughout an institution.
