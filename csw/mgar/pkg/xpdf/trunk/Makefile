DESCRIPTION = Open source viewer for Portable Document Format (PDF) files
define BLURB
  Xpdf is an open source viewer for Portable Document Format (PDF) files. 
  (These are also sometimes also called 'Acrobat' files, from the name of 
  Adobe's PDF software.) The Xpdf project also includes a PDF text extractor, 
  PDF-to-PostScript converter, and various other utilities. 
  Xpdf is designed to be small and efficient. It can use Type 1, TrueType, 
  or standard X fonts.
