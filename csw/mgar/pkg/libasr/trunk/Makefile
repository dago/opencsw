DESCRIPTION = A free, simple and portable asynchronous resolver library
define BLURB
 libasr is a free, simple and portable asynchronous resolver library.
 
 It allows to run dns queries and perform hostname resolutions in a fully asynchronous fashion. The implementation is thread-less, fork-less, and does not make use of signals or other "tricks" that might get in the developer's way. The API was initially developped for the OpenBSD operating system, where it is natively supported.
 
 This library is intended to bring this interface to other systems. It is originally provided as a support library for the portable version of the OpenSMTPD daemon, but it can be used in any other contexts. It is known to work on the following systems:
 
     * Linux
     * FreeBSD
     * NetBSD
     * DragonFly
     * MacOSX
 
 The primary source of information about libasr is the github repository.
