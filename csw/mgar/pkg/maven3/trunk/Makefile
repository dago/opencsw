define BLURB
Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool. Based on
the concept of a project object model (POM), Maven can manage a
project's build, reporting and documentation from a central
piece of information.

Maven's primary goal is to allow a developer to comprehend the complete
state of a development effort in the shortest period of time. In order
to attain this goal there are several areas of conce rn that Maven
attempts to deal with:

   * Making the build process easy
   * Providing a uniform build system
   * Providing quality project information
   * Providing guidelines for best practices development
   * Allowing transparent migration to new features
