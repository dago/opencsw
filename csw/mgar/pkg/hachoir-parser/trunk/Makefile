DESCRIPTION = Allows to view and edit a binary stream field by field (core)
define BLURB
  Hachoir is a Python library that allows to view and edit a binary stream
  field by field. In other words, Hachoir allows you to "browse" any binary
  stream just like you browse directories and files. A file is split in a tree
  of fields, where the smallest field is just one bit.
