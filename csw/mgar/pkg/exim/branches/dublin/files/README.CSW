IMPORTANT NOTES:

Relying on sendmail-client
--------------------------

As of release 4.80, the exim package relies on the sendmail-client
service provided by Solaris 10 to relay mail from /usr/lib/sendmail
to localhost:25.  We no longer fiddle with the system files such as
/usr/lib/sendmail, newaliases, etc.  This should be more robust
against patching and will also allow exim to be installed during a
jumpstart as we no longer rely on user input during the installation.

It will likely mean that you need to tweak either your submit.cf file
for sendmail or your exim.conf (to change domain qualifications).

Service Management Facility (SMF)
---------------------------------

As of release 4.62, the Exim package supports the new Service
Management Facility introduced in Solaris 10. The package auto-detects
whether or not it can use SMF on a given system. If SMF is not
detected, the traditional init.d script will be installed together with
the proper runlevel links.

If the system supports SMF, the package will instead install
/opt/csw/var/svc/manifest/network/exim.xml (the service description) and
/opt/csw/lib/svc/method/svc-exim (the start/stop script). The FRMI
(Fault Managed Resource Identifier) for CSWexim is
svc:/network/cswexim.

Example:

# /usr/sbin/svcadm enable svc:/network/cswexim

Environment File
----------------
Also new in package 4.62 is support for an "environment" file, namely
/opt/csw/etc/exim/exim-env.sh, which can be used to set up environment
variables or to modify the command-line parameters before exim is
started. This file is "sourced" by the startup scripts
(/etc/init.d/CSWexim or /opt/csw/lib/svc/method/svc-exim) which have
been modified to honor the environment variable $EXIM_PARAMS to contain
command line parameters for Exim.

This file is persistent across updates, so if you modify it, your
changes will stick around.

Sender Policy Framework (SPF)
-----------------------------

Releases 4.43-4.51 of the Exim package support the Sender Policy
Framework (SPF) based on libspf2-1.0.0. Later releases are using
libspf2-1.2.x. (There has been an API change between libspf2-1.0.x and
libspf2-1.2.x.)

Also, please be aware that SPF support is still experimental. See
http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.mail.exim.exiscan.user/2245 (the archive
of the Exiscan mailing-list) for information about problems that can
potentially to occur when using libspf2.

Exiscan
-------

Starting with release 4.50 the Exim source already includes the
functionality formerly distributed as exiscan patches.
