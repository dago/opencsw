Xsnow is available freely and you may give it to other people as is,
but I retain all rights. Therefore it does not classify as 'Public
Domain' software. It *is* allowed to package Xsnow for Unix/Linux 
distributions, CD-Roms etc, and to make the necessary changes to
makefiles etc. to facilitate this.
