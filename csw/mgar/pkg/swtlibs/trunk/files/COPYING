    GTK+ Binding

   The "GTK+ Binding" is a binding to the GTK+ API. The Content may include any or all of the following files:

   The following files in the plug-in JAR shall be defined as the native code portion of the GTK+ Binding:
     * libswt-atk-gtk-xxxx.so (where "xxxx" is the version number)
     * libswt-pi-gtk-xxxx.so (where "xxxx" is the version number)

   The following files in both the plug-in JAR and the src.zip shall be defined respectively as the bytecode and source code
   portions of the GTK+ Binding:
     * The contents of the directory org/eclipse/swt/internal/accessibility/gtk (but not including any sub-directories)
     * The contents of the directory org/eclipse/swt/internal/cde (but not including any sub-directories)
     * The contents of the directory org/eclipse/swt/internal/gtk (but not including any sub-directories)
     * The contents of the directory org/eclipse/swt/internal/kde (but not including any sub-directories)

   The GTK+ Binding contains portions of GTK+ ("Library"). GTK+ is made available by The Free Software Foundation. Use of the
   Library is governed by the terms and conditions of the GNU Lesser General Public License Version 2.1 ("LGPL"). Use of the GTK+
                                                                                                                       About (p2 of 4)
   Binding on a standalone basis, is also governed by the terms and conditions of the LGPL. A copy of the LGPL is provided with
   the Content (lgpl-v21.txt) and is also available at http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html.

   In accordance with Section 6 of the LGPL, you may combine or link a "work that uses the Library" (e.g. the SWT) with the
   Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library (e.g. the GTK+ Binding) and distribute that work under the terms
   of your choice (e.g. the EPL) provided you comply with all other terms and conditions of Section 6 as well as other Sections
   of the LGPL. Please note, if you modify the GTK+ Binding such modifications shall be governed by the terms and conditions of
   the LGPL. Also note, the terms of the EPL permit you to modify the combined work and the source code of the combined work is
   provided for debugging purposes so there is no need to reverse engineer the combined work.

    Independent JPEG Group's JPEG software release 6b

   This software is based in part on the work of the Independent JPEG Group's JPEG software release 6b ("LIBJPEG"). LIBJPEG was
   used to implement the decoding of JPEG format files in Java (TM). The Content does NOT include any portion of the LIBJPEG file
   ansi2knr.c.

   Your use of LIBJPEG is subject to the terms and conditions located in the about_files/IJG_README file which is included with
   the Content.

   The IJG's website is located at http://ijg.org.

   The following changes were made to the LIBJPEG code in the Content:
    1. In Java, pointer math is not allowed so indexing was used instead.
    2. Function pointers were replaced with switch statements.
    3. The virtual memory, tracing and progress monitoring were removed.
    4. The error handling was simplified and now uses Java exceptions.
