This is a short documentation file for the OpenCSW targetted implementation of
linux style "alternatives", aka "update-alternatives" in debian.

USER LEVEL DOCS

  alternatives --display shortname
  # will display any currently installed symlink for "shortname"
  # will display any installed packages that provide "shortname".
  # will display current decision mode for --install, for "shortname"
  #    (either "auto", or [?? something else]
  

  alternatives --config shortname
  # will display any installed packages that provide "shortname".
  # will prompt user for their preferred choice of package to use,
     or to stick/revert to auto mode.

  alternatives --auto shortname
  # sets shortname to be auto-chosen. Will adjust symlinks now, if appropriate

  alternatives --set shortname /provided/path
  # sets shortname to be the implementation provided by /provided/path,
  #  IF PRESENT.
  # Basically, sets that one to be artificially "highest priority", then
  # configure the link now.
  # If the manual setting is invalid, it will be ignored

  alternatives --install /full/path/name shortname /path/xx priority [...]
  # notifies the alternatives handler, and says,
  # "hey, here's an implementation. If its highest priority right now,
  #   use it!"
  # Unlike redhat, we dont actually "register" anything.

  alternatives --remove shortname /full/path/name
  # basically, a hint to reconfigure shortname "as appropriate",
  # while ignoring anything matching /full/path/name as a valid alternative

  alternatives --list
  # Gives a short list of programs "known" to alternatives, on this machine.

  alternatives --relink-missing
  # if you are in a situation where symlinks have not been created,
  # call this, and it will create any missing ones as appropriate
