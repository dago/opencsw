A quickie readme for the future, about this "alternatives" implementation:

Phil decided that a from-scratch, CSW-custom implementation was needed,
because the debian one was hugely bloated, and the redhat smaller one,
did not play nicely with NFS-shared /opt/csw
So pleaes dont go getting ideas that we can migrated back to redhat,etc
in the future! :) we tried, and it failed.
