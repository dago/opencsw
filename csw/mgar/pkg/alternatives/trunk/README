A quickie readme for the future, about this "alternatives" implementation:

Phil decided that a from-scratch, CSW-custom implementation was needed,
because the debian one was hugely bloated, and the redhat smaller one,
did not play nicely with NFS-shared /opt/csw
So pleaes dont go getting ideas that we can migrated back to redhat,etc
in the future! :) we tried, and it failed.


Internal implementation notes:

 My initial version seems to expect each "alternative" to have its own
file in /opt/csw/share/alternatives/xyz.
One line per file only would be nice, please

When a choice is manually set (overriding auto settings), it records that
fact by making a symlink from the shipped file, to 
/etc/opt/csw/alternatives/(progname)

This way, you can have the binary, and alternatives files per software,
NFS-shared, but then have machine-local overrides.

Reminder: Do NOT have to get fancy with the class action script not 
 getting called with pathnames on sparse zones with pkg-inherit-dir,
 because since /opt/csw is shared, the symlink will already be in place.
