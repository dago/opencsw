DESCRIPTION = GNU Data Access
define BLURB
 GNU Data Access (GDA) is an attempt to provide uniform access to different
 kinds of data sources (databases, information servers, mail spools, etc).
 It is a complete architecture that provides all you need to access your data.
 It is defined by a set of plugin APIs as generic as possible
 (but very powerful at the same time) so that any kind of data source
 can be accessed through them.
