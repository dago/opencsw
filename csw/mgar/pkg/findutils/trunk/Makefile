DESCRIPTION = Find utilities
define BLURB
  The findutils package consists of three programs. `find' is a program which
  searches a directory tree to find a file or group of files. It walks the
  directory tree and reports all occurences of a file matching the user's
  specifications. `locate' scans one or more databases of filenames and
  displays any matches. `xargs' builds and executes command lines by gathering
  together arguments it reads on the standard input. Most often, these
  arguments are lists of file names generated by `find'.
