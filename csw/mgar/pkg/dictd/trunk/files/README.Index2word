     The "word" search strategy matches any single word, even if part
of a longer headword or a multi-word entry.  Since it must search the
whole index file, it is not as fast as the default "exact" strategy.

     If an optional index_word file is provided, a word search is
much faster.  The dictfmt_index2word.1 script (provided in the
dictfmt package) will produce this index_word file (see the manual
page dictfmt_index2word(1)).

     An index_word file is included in the dictd.conf file as
follows:

database gcide
 {
  data  /opt/csw/share/dictd/gcide.dict.dz
  index /opt/csw/share/dictd/gcide.index
  index_word /opt/csw/share/dictd/gcide.word
}

    Versions 1.2 and higher of dictdconfig handle .word files
automatically.
