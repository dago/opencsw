     The "suffix" search strategy matches the last portion of the
headword.  Since it must search the whole index file, it is not as
fast as the default "exact" strategy.

     If an optional index_suffix file is provided, a suffix search is
much faster.  The dictfmt_index2suffix.1 script (provided in the
dictfmt package) will produce this index_suffix file (see the manual
page dictfmt_index2suffix(1)).

     An index_suffix file is included in the dictd.conf file as
follows:

database gcide
 {
  data  /opt/csw/share/dictd/gcide.dict.dz
  index /opt/csw/share/dictd/gcide.index
  index_suffix /opt/csw/share/dictd/gcide.suffix
}

    Versions 1.2 and higher of dictdconfig handle .suffix files
automatically.
