# /etc/opt/csw/dictd/dictd.conf

# This is the configuration file for /opt/csw/sbin/dictd.  The access
# specification included in this file allows access only from the
# localhost.  If this machine is acting as a server for a network you
# will probably want to add additional access specifications in this
# file.  See the dictd manpage - man dictd.

# A sample database section is generated automatically upon
# installation or removal of the dictd package or any dictionary
# database package.  Replace the ``include /var/opt/csw/lib/dictd/db.list''
# line below if you wish to provide a custom database section.
# Customization may also be achieved via the optional dictdconfig
# order override file /etc/opt/csw/dictd/dictd.order.  See the dictdconfig
# manpage - man dictdconfig.
