DESCRIPTION = A deliberately simple workload generator for POSIX systems
define BLURB
  The tool started out as a very simple way to generate work on a
  computer. It has pretty much stayed as simple as reasonably possible. It
  is a single file called stress.c whose internal organization is in
  essence a loop that forks worker processes and then waits for them to
  either complete normally or exit with an error. It has been used in a
  lot of product development labs as well as in research projects.
