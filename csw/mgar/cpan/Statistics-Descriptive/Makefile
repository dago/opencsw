DESCRIPTION = module of basic descriptive statistical functions.
define BLURB
  This module provides basic functions used in descriptive statistics. It has
  an object oriented design and supports two different types of data storage
  and calculation objects: sparse and full. With the sparse method, none of
  the data is stored and only a few statistical measures are available. Using
  the full method, the entire data set is retained and additional functions
  are available.
