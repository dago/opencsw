DESCRIPTION = error/exception handling in an OO-ish way
define BLURB
  The Error package provides two interfaces. Firstly Error provides a
  procedural interface to exception handling. Secondly Error is a base class
  for errors/exceptions that can either be thrown, for subsequent catch, or
  can simply be recorded.
