DESCRIPTION = create and manipulate PAR distributions
define BLURB
  This module creates and manipulates PAR distributions. They are
  architecture-specific PAR files, containing everything under blib/ of CPAN
  distributions after their make or Build stage, a META.yml describing
  metadata of the original CPAN distribution, and a MANIFEST detailing all
  files within it. Digitally signed PAR distributions will also contain a
  SIGNATURE file.
