DESCRIPTION = A window manager that multiplexes a physical terminal.
define BLURB
  Screen is a full-screen window manager that multiplexes a physical terminal
  between several processes, typically interactive shells. Each virtual terminal
  provides the functions of the DEC VT100 terminal and, in addition, several
  control functions from the ANSI X3.64 (ISO 6429) and ISO 2022 standards (e.g.,
  insert/delete line and support for multiple character sets).
