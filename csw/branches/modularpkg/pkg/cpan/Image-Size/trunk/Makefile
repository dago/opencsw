DESCRIPTION = read the dimensions of an image in several popular formats
define BLURB
  The Image::Size library is based upon the wwwis script written by Alex
  Knowles (alex@ed.ac.uk), a tool to examine HTML and add 'width' and 'height'
  parameters to image tags. The sizes are cached internally based on file
  name, so multiple calls on the same file name (such as images used in
  bulleted lists, for example) do not result in repeated computations.
