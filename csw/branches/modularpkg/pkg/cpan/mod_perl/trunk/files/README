This is a package of "mod_perl". See http://perl.apache.org
for documentation.

As well as enabling the module in httpd.conf, it also creates and
configures a directory for perl handler use: /opt/csw/apache/perl
Executable perl scripts in that directory will be directly handled by
the mod_perl module. 
A test routine is provided. test it by using
links http://localhost/perl/test.pl

As mentioned by the postinstall script, you will have to manually 
restart the server, for the changes to take effect.
(you can do this safely, with  /opt/csw/apache/bin/apache restart)

NOTE:
This mod_perl module has in its @INC path
 (in additional to the normal dirs)
  /opt/csw/apache/lib/perl
