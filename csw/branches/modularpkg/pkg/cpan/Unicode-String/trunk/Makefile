DESCRIPTION = String of Unicode characters (UCS2/UTF16)
define BLURB
  A Unicode::String object represents a sequence of Unicode characters. The
  Unicode Standard is a fixed-width, uniform encoding scheme for written
  characters and text. This encoding treats alphabetic characters, ideographic
  characters, and symbols identically, which means that they can be used in
  any mixture and with equal facility. Unicode is modeled on the ASCII
  character set, but uses a 16-bit encoding to support full multilingual text.
