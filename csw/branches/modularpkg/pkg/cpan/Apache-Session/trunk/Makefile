DESCRIPTION = a persistence framework for session data
define BLURB
  Apache::Session is a persistence framework which is particularly useful for
  tracking session data between httpd requests. Apache::Session is designed to
  work with Apache and mod_perl, but it should work under CGI and other web
  servers, and it also works outside of a web server altogether.
