DESCRIPTION = maketext from already interpolated strings
define BLURB
  This module is a subclass of Locale::Maketext, with additional support for
  localizing messages that already contains interpolated variables. This is
  most useful when the messages are returned by external modules -- for
  example, to match dir: command not found against [_1]: command not found.
