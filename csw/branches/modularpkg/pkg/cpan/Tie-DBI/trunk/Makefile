DESCRIPTION = tie hashes to DBI relational databases
define BLURB
  This module allows you to tie Perl associative arrays (hashes) to SQL
  databases using the DBI interface.  The tied hash is associated with a table
  in a local or networked database. One column becomes the hash key. Each row
  of the table becomes an associative array, from which individual fields can
  be set or retrieved.
