DESCRIPTION = mail archive tool
define BLURB
  Hypermail is a program that takes a file of mail messages in UNIX mailbox
  format and generates a set of cross-referenced HTML documents. Each file
  that is created represents a separate message in the mail archive and
  contains links to other articles, so that the entire archive can be browsed
  in a number of ways by following links. Archives generated by Hypermail can
  be incrementally updated, and Hypermail is set by default to only update
  archives when changes are detected.
