DESCRIPTION = Create bubble-babble fingerprints
define BLURB
  Digest::BubbleBabble takes a message digest (generated by either of the MD5
  or SHA-1 message digest algorithms) and creates a fingerprint of that digest
  in "bubble babble" format. Bubble babble is a method of representing a
  message digest as a string of "real" words, to make the fingerprint easier
  to remember. The "words" are not necessarily real words, but they look more
  like words than a string of hex characters.
