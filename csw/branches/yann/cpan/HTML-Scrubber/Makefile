DESCRIPTION = extension for scrubbing/sanitizing html
define BLURB
  If you wanna "scrub" or "sanitize" html input in a reliable an flexible
  fashion, then this module is for you.  I wasn't satisfied with
  HTML::Sanitizer because it is based on HTML::TreeBuilder, so I thought I'd
  write something similar that works directly with HTML::Parser.
