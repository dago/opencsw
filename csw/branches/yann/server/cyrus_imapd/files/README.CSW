Notes for Cyrus Imap
--------------------

- Cyrus configuration

Rename /opt/csw/etc/cyrus/imapd.conf.CSW to /opt/csw/etc/cyrus/imapd.conf and
 /opt/csw/etc/cyrus/cyrus.conf.CSW to /opt/csw/etc/cyrus/cyrus.conf
and customize these files according to your needs.

Warning: daemons which can only be launched from the master process live in
the /opt/csw/libexec/cyrus directory, other binaries which can be launched 
from the command line by root or cyrus user, live now in /opt/csw/libexec/cyrus
and are symlinked in /opt/csw/sbin, but they will be moved definitely in /opt/csw/sbin 
in the next major version.

The consequence is that you must use the absolute path of theses binaries in cyrus.conf
(i.e. /opt/csw/sbin/ctl_cyrusdb instead of ctl_cyrusdb) so that everything works after 
the next major upgrade.


- Cyrus Authentication

This package is configured by default to use saslauthd to authenticate users but
it doesn't depend on it since Cyrus Imap can be used without it.

So to have authentication working:
	- install saslauthd, pkg-get install saslauthd
	- configure it
	- launch the daemon, /etc/init.d/cswsaslauthd start
	- add the cyrus user to the sasl group, usermod -G sasl cyrus
	- launch or relaunch cyrus, /etc/init.d/cswcyrus start

Authentication should be working.

You can also directly use Cyrus Imap directly with berkeleydb (or mysql, or postgres) 
user databases. You must then change the sasl_pwcheck_method parameter to auxprop
in /opt/csw/etc/cyrus/imapd.conf, but remember that Cyrus runs as the cyrus user, so
for example, berkeleydb databases files will have to be readable by the cyrus user.


- Enable SSL/TLS

To enable ssl and tls for Imap/Pop/..., create the certificate and fill accordingly the 
paramaters tls_cert_file and tls_key_file in /opt/csw/etc/cyrus/imapd.conf.
You can use different certificates for each service by using parameters <service>_tls_cert_file 
and <service>_tls_key_file (imap_tls_cert_file, pop3_tls_key_file, imaps_tls_key_file, ...).

Then for ssl, also uncomment the lines concerning pops and imaps in /opt/csw/etc/cyrus/cyrus.conf


- Configure Sendmail to deliver to cyrus mailboxes

You will have to add the following lines in  sendmail.mc:

define(`confLOCAL_MAILER', `cyrusv2')dnl
define(`CYRUSV2_MAILER_ARGS', `FILE /opt/csw/var/cyrus/config/socket/lmtp')dnl
MAILER(`cyrusv2')dnl


If Sendmail and Cyrus are on different hosts, you must use TCP instead of socket for Sendmail/Cyrus
communication, change the CYRUSV2_MAILER_ARGS line with this one:

define(`CYRUSV2_MAILER_ARGS', `TCP name_of_the_cyrus_host lmtp')dnl

and enable lmtp tcp listening by uncommenting this line in /opt/csw/etc/cyrus/cyrus.conf:

lmtp         cmd="lmtpd" listen="lmtp" prefork=0


By default, sendmail will not read .forward files with the Cyrus mailer, because Cyrus is often used 
with virtual users who do not have home directory on the host. 
If you use Cyrus with local users, you must tell it explicitely to sendmail so it reads .forward files.
To do so, add the following line in sendmail.cf:

define(`CYRUSV2_MAILER_FLAGS', `mA@/:|w')dnl

The w flags tells sendmail users are local, these are generic mailer flags explained here:

- Differences with upstream version

Several patches have been applied so Cyrus is more useable in production environment

 - cyrus-imapd-2.3.7-autocreate-0.10-1.diff and cyrus-imapd-2.3.3-autosieve-0.6.0.diff, 
   available at http://email.uoa.gr/projects/cyrus/ 
   These patches enable automatic inbox creation and automatic folder creation when a 
   sieve filter requires it

 - cyrus-imapd-acceptinvalidfrom.patch and cyrus-imapd-2.3.7-nobarenewlinescheck.patch, 
   available in the Fedora Core package and own-made.
   These patches make Cyrus more tolerant with non-standard emails sent by a lot of bad 
   mail user agent, they allow respectively to accept 8bits characters in header 
   (configurable in /opt/csw/etc/cyrus/imapd.conf), to accept email with colon-less From 
   ("From john@doe") header and to allow email with a bare newline in it.
