DESCRIPTION = test testsuites built with Test::Builder
define BLURB
  The testing system is designed to be used by performing a three step process
  for each test you wish to test. This process starts with using test_out and
  test_err in advance to declare what the testsuite you are testing will
  output with Test::Builder to stdout and stderr
