DESCRIPTION = A network traffic usage monitor.
define BLURB
  ntop is a network probe that shows network usage in a way similar to what top
  does for processes. In interactive mode, it displays the network status on the
  user's terminal. In Web mode, it acts as a Web server, creating an HTML dump
  of the network status. It sports a NetFlow/sFlow emitter/collector, an
  HTTP-based client interface for creating ntop-centric monitoring applications,
  and RRD for persistently storing traffic statistics.
