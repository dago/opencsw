DESCRIPTION = easily build XS extensions that depend on XS extensions
define BLURB
  This module tries to make it easy to build Perl extensions that use
  functions and typemaps provided by other perl extensions. This means that a
  perl extension is treated like a shared library that provides also a C and
  an XS interface besides the perl one.
