DESCRIPTION = read/write buffer class
define BLURB
  Data::Buffer implements a low-level binary buffer in which you can get and
  put integers, strings, and other data. Internally the implementation is
  based on pack and unpack, such that Data::Buffer is really a layer on top of
  those built-in functions.
