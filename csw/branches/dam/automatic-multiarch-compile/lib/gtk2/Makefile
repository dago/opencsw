DESCRIPTION = A library for creating graphical user interfaces.
define BLURB
  GTK, which stands for the Gimp ToolKit, is a library for creating graphical
  user interfaces. It is designed to be small and efficient, but still flexible
  enough to allow the programmer freedom in the interfaces created. GTK provides
  some unique features over standard widget libraries.
