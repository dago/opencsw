DESCRIPTION = calculate windows/subsets/pages of arrays.
define BLURB
  Many applications require that a large set of results be broken down into a
  smaller set of 'windows', or 'pages' in web language. Array::Window
  implements an algorithm specifically for dealing with these windows. It is
  very flexible and permissive, making adjustments to the window as needed.
