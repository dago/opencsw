Notes about the Blastwave package of libgphoto2
-----------------------------------------------

Starting with libgphoto 2.3.1, two packages per architecture are
provided.

The first package has been built on Solaris 8 and is intended for use
on Solaris 8 and 9 machines. This package is equivalent to the
previously available package. Since Solaris 8 and 9 don't have libusb,
USB support had to be turned off for this package.

The other package has been built on Solaris 10 and is intended for use
on Solaris 10 and later. This package has been compiled with USB
support enabled. As long as /usr/sfw/lib/libusb.so is present on the
system (package SUNWlibusb), this library will provide access to all
USB camera models supported.

USB support has been tested on a Sun Ultra 60 workstation running
Solaris 10 using a Canon PowerShot G1 and a Canon PowerShot S50.

Please refer to [1] for more information on how to set up your USB
camera with Solaris (this is a one-time step per camera model).
