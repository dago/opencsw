   Solaris 10: USB Digital Camera HOWTO

   The following instructions are very "generic", and applicable to all
   makes/models of digital cameras. Sony DSC-V1 camera was used to show
   all the examples.

   Since the vendor supplied Windows driver cannot be installed on
   Solaris, it needs some effort to make the digital camera work on
   Solaris 10. The steps are as follows:

     * Bind the device (digital camera) to the ugen driver. Then the ugen
       driver can talk to the digital camera (device).

       ugen is a generic USB driver, which is part of the Solaris USB
       Driver Development Kit, presents USB devices to applications
       through a standard read/write UNIX interface.

         1. Remove the ugen driver from the system, if it was already
            installed. If in doubt, run the following command anyway:
            % rem_drv ugen
            Driver (ugen) not installed.

         2. Plug-in the camera to the system; and then run prtconf -v
            command, to find the device ID for the attached digital
            camera.
            % prtconf -v
                            ....
            device (driver not attached)
                Hardware properties:
                    name='usb-product-name' type=string items=1
                        value='Sony PTP'
                    name='usb-vendor-name' type=string items=1
                        value='Sony'
                            ....
                            ....
                    name='compatible' type=string items=8
                        value='usb54c,4e.150' + 'usb54c,4e' + 'usbif54c,class6.
1.1' +
                              'usbif54c,class6.1' + 'usbif54c,class6' + 'usbif,
class6.1.1' +
                              'usbif,class6.1' + 'usbif,class6'  name='reg' typ
e=int items=1
                        value=00000001
                            ....

         3. Add the driver alias (usb54c,4e.150 in this example. 054c is
            the vendor-id for Sony corporation, and 004e is the
            product-id for DSC-xxx (PTP)) with add_drv command, if this
            is the first device to be bound to ugen. Run add_drv command,
            as root.

            % add_drv -m '* 0666 root sys' -i '"usb54c,4e.150"' ugen

            Refer to the man page of add_drv for information about -m, -i
            flags and use of double quotes in specifying a driver alias
            that contains numbers.

            Note:

            If add_drv command throws an error saying ("usb54c,4e.150")
            already in use as a driver or alias, that means another
            device is already bound to ugen. So, to bind the new device
            to ugen, run update_drv command, as root.

            % update_drv -a -m '* 0666 root sys' -i '"usb54c,4e.150"' ugen

            If update_drv still complains about the driver or alias in
            use, try to remove the driver and add it again, as explained
            above

         4. Bind this device (digital camera) to ugen by default that
            have no driver

            % echo "ugen-default-binding=\"usb54c,4e.150\";" >> /kernel/drv/uhci.conf
            % echo "ugen-default-binding=\"usb54c,4e.150\";" >> /kernel/drv/ehci.conf
            % echo "ugen-default-binding=\"usb54c,4e.150\";" >> /kernel/drv/ohci.conf

         5. Check /etc/driver_aliases and make sure that the correct
            compatible name is in /etc/driver_aliases

            % grep ugen /etc/driver_aliases
            ugen "usb54c,4e.150"

         6. Reboot the machine (only for the very first time)

         7. Plug-in the camera and use prtconf -D to check if ugen has
            been bound to the device

            % prtconf -D | grep ugen
            device, instance #1 (driver name: ugen)

     * Use gphoto2, to auto detect the camera. gphoto2 is an application
       that allows users to operate/download images from digital cameras
       on Solaris (*nix, in general). On Solaris 10, gphoto2 is available
       under /usr/sfw/bin directory, by default.

       % gphoto2 --auto-detect
       Model                          Port
       ----------------------------------------------------------
       Sony DSC-F707V (PTP mode)      usb:
            * Now either use gphoto2 command line tool or gtkam GUI tool, to
              download all the photos.
                 + gphoto2 --help, shows all options of gphoto2
                 + gphoto2 -P, downloads all the pictures from the digital
                   camera to the current directory
                 + gtkam is also available under /usr/sfw/bin directory, by
                   default

   Note that this is a one time only effort, and these steps need not be
   repeated everytime the digital camera has been plugged in to the
   system.
