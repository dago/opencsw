<h1><a name="csw_build_system__getting_started_guide">CSW Build System - Getting Started Guide</a></h1>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>The CSW build system was developed to manage large package builds with many
inter-dependencies.  It is based on the GARNOME project
[<a href="http://cipherfunk.org/garnome/">http://cipherfunk.org/garnome/</a>], which itself is based on the GAR ports
system, developed for the Linux BBC (bootable business card) project
[<a href="http://www.lnx-bbc.org/garchitecture.html">http://www.lnx-bbc.org/garchitecture.html</a>].  There is a great deal of
information on the GAR Architecture home page, nearly all of which is relevant
to the CSW build system.  There are some minor departures, as neither Linux
BBC nor GARNOME are concerned with building packages, but the core build
system is still very similar to the systems used in these two projects.</p>
<p>The CSW build system is designed to store all of the information necessary to
build and create Solaris packages in a single directory hierarchy.  Package
inter-dependencies can be easily expressed, and are followed when doing bulk
builds.  The system separates build management from package creation, with the
bulk of package creation managed by a Perl script and simple package .spec
files.  GNU make manages the build, using a <em>cookie</em> system to track the
progress of a build.</p>
<p>This quick start guide will walk through the addition of a new package to the
build system.  It is by no means an exhaustive guide for the build system.
If you have any questions regarding the build system, or run into trouble when
attempting something out of the ordinary, please contact me at
<a href="mailto:comand@blastwave.org,">comand@blastwave.org,</a> or send a mail to the <a href="mailto:maintainers@lists.blastwave.org">maintainers@lists.blastwave.org</a>
mailing list.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="environment">Environment</a></h2>
<p>The first step is to set up your environment.  As the CSW system was developed
using GNU tools named normally (e.g. without the 'g' prefix), it is necessary
to create some custom links to ensure the correct tool versions can be picked
up.  By default, the directory <code>$(HOME)/bin</code> is placed near the start of the
PATH.  This is well suited for soft linking the required 'g' prefixed
utilities from /opt/csw/bin (or the bootstrap install directory, if
appropriate) into a path you control.  The following utilities must be in the
PATH for builds to work (real name in parens, where GNU tools should be
soft linked to their non-prefix names):</p>
<pre>
 make (gmake), tar (gtar), wget, md5sum (gmd5sum), grep (ggrep)
 patch (gpatch), diff (gdiff), ln (gln), mv (gmv), cp (gcp)
 bzip2, unzip, gzip, find (gfind), xargs (gxargs), install (ginstall),
 perl</pre>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="creating_the_package_directory">Creating the Package Directory</a></h2>
<p>To get started, copy the gar.cswrc.mk file to your local home directory:</p>
<pre>
 $ cp gar.cswrc.mk ~/.garrc</pre>
<p>Edit this file, adding your own name to <code>SPKG_VENDOR</code>, email address in
<code>SPKG_EMAIL</code>, and other settings.  <code>SPKG_EXPORT</code> is where built packages will
be placed.  <code>GARCHIVEDIR</code> is where to cache downloaded sources, and
<code>GARCHIVEPATH</code> is a space separated list of paths to look for cached software
in.</p>
<p>Once you have set up your own environment, the next step is to  Determine the
correct package category.</p>
<p>First, choose a category from the list:</p>
<pre>
 apps        - Applications (e.g. trac)
 cpan        - Perl modules from CPAN (e.g. IPC-Run)
 devel       - Developent utilities (e.g. bison)
 gnome       - GNOME applications/system (e.g. gaim)
 lang        - Programming languages and support (e.g. perl)
 lib         - Libraries (e.g. bdb)
 net         - Network Utilities (e.g. curl)
 server      - Network Servers (e.g. apache)
 utils       - General Utilities (e.g. sudo)
 xtra        - Extras (e.g. icon sets)</pre>
<p>Once you've determined the most appropriate category for your new
package, copy the package template into the category directory, and configure
the Makefile.</p>
<pre>
 $ cp -R template apps/povray</pre>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="setting_up_the_makefile">Setting up the Makefile</a></h2>
<p>Within the apps/povray subdirectory, there will be a Makefile, a 'files'
directory, and a sample package spec.  Start with the Makefile.  The template
Makefile looks like this:</p>
<pre>
 GARNAME = PACKAGE
 GARVERSION = 1.0
 CATEGORIES = CATEGORY
 
 DESCRIPTION = BRIEF DESCRIPTION
 define BLURB
   LONG DESCRIPTION
 endef
 
 MASTER_SITES =
 DISTFILES  = $(GARNAME)-$(GARVERSION).tar.gz
 DISTFILES += CSWpackage.gspec
 
 CONFIGURE_ARGS = $(DIRPATHS)
 
 include ../category.mk</pre>
<p><code>GARNAME</code> is the name of the software, as it is downloaded from the source
site.  For our Povray package, we should set:</p>
<pre>
 GARNAME = povray</pre>
<p>As we want to build Povray version 3.6.1, we set <code>GARVERSION</code> to:</p>
<pre>
 GARVERSION = 3.6.1</pre>
<p>And to round out the header, we need to ensure the category is properly
set:</p>
<pre>
 CATEGORY = apps</pre>
<p>The <code>DESCRIPTION</code> string will be used to construct the pkginfo <code>NAME</code>
variable during packaging.  The <code>BLURB</code> is a free-form field which can be used
to enter longer descriptions of the package -- it is typically filled with
text from the 'About' section of the package's freshmeat.net entry.</p>
<p>For Povray:</p>
<pre>
 DESCRIPTION = A high-quality tool for creating 3D graphics
 define BLURB
   The Persistence of Vision Raytracer is a high-quality tool for creating 3D
   graphics. It is available in official versions for Windows, Mac OS/Mac OS X,
   and i86 Linux.  
 endef</pre>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="describing_the_download">Describing the Download</a></h2>
<p>Next, <code>MASTER_SITES</code> needs to be set up.  This is a space separated path
which may include file, http or ftp URLs.  Usually, most packages only require
a single entry to <code>MASTER_SITES</code>.  There are some predefined master sites to
assist with common situations -- <code>SF_MIRROR</code> is for SourceForge.net,
<code>CPAN_MIRROR</code> for CPAN modules, <code>GNU_MIRROR</code> for GNU based software, and
<code>NGNU_MIRROR</code> for non-GNU projects hosted by GNU.  These mirror settings can
be found near the bottom of the gar.conf.mk file in the csw root directory.</p>
<p>For Povray, we need to set the single Povray source repo.  The primary
download link for Povray is a redirect:</p>
<pre>
 <a href="http://www.povray.org/redirect/www.povray.org/ftp/pub/povray/Official/Unix/povray-3.6.tar.gz">http://www.povray.org/redirect/www.povray.org/ftp/pub/povray/Official/Unix/povray-3.6.tar.gz</a></pre>
<p>Unraveling the redirect, we get the following path:</p>
<pre>
 <a href="http://www.povray.org/ftp/pub/povray/Official/Unix/">http://www.povray.org/ftp/pub/povray/Official/Unix/</a></pre>
<p>and file:</p>
<pre>
 povray-3.6.1.tar.bz2</pre>
<p>In the Makefile, set:</p>
<pre>
 MASTER_SITES = <a href="http://www.povray.org/ftp/pub/povray/Official/Unix/">http://www.povray.org/ftp/pub/povray/Official/Unix/</a></pre>
<p>and:</p>
<pre>
 DISTFILES = $(GARNAME)-$(GARVERSION).tar.bz2</pre>
<p>The package template assumes .tar.gz extensions, but it is able to handle a
wide variety of archive types.  Using tar.bz2 limits disk usage for the
software cache (<code>GARCHIVE</code>) and reduces download times for uncached software.</p>
<p>The other template entry for <code>DISTFILES</code> is for a .gspec file.  This is a
package spec file which describes how to create Solaris packages.  For now,
this file can be left in the <code>DISTFILES</code> list.  We will configure it later
when it's time to create our first Solaris package.</p>
<p>In addition to the <code>DISTFILES</code> variable, a <code>PATCHFILES</code> variable is provided
to deal explicitly with patches.  Custom patches should be stored in the
<code>files</code> directory.  Patches which can be downloaded via http and ftp URLs can
also be included in the space separated patch list.  These patches will be
automatically applied prior to the configure stage.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="fetching_software">Fetching Software</a></h2>
<p>Now that the basics of the software package are set up, it's time to download
the software.  This can be done by invoking 'make fetch'.  This must be
executed from a system with external network access.  If proxies are required,
set the <code>http_proxy</code> and/or <code>ftp_proxy</code> environmental variables within your
<code>~/.garrc</code> file.  The system uses <code>wget</code> to fetch software, and wget will
respect these environmental variables.  Other access methods, including SOCKS,
can be configured to allow external access.</p>
<p>After a successful <code>make fetch</code>, the package will be in the newly created
<code>download</code> directory within apps/povray.  The next step is to run <code>make
makesum</code>.  This creates a <code>checksums</code> file in the apps/povray directory
containing md5 sums for all files contained in the <code>DISTFILES</code> and
<code>PATCHFILES</code> lists.  In this example, running <code>make makesum</code> will result in
a checksums file with the povray archive, and our template <code>.gspec</code> file.
Verify that the md5 sum of the file matches the source (most software will
have md5 sums posted somewhere on the download site).  Once the checksum is
created, it will be easy to tell if the source was tampered with in some way
since your last download (e.g.  updated without changing versions, malicious
tampering, etc).</p>
<p>Next, to save bandwidth, we can cache the software in our <code>GARCHIVE</code>
directory.  Run <code>make garchive</code> to copy any downloaded software.  Files which
are included in the <code>files</code> directory will not be cached in <code>GARCHIVE</code>.
Only files which were fetched from some remote location (file, ftp, http) will
be cached.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="configure_the_software">Configure the Software</a></h2>
<p>The next steps really don't involve the build system much.  This stage of the
process involves determining how the package needs to be built, including
configure arguments, environmental variables, compiler flags, etc.  For simple
packages, nearly all of these are managed by the default template.</p>
<p>The first step here is to extract the package.  To do this, run 'make
extract'.  This extracts the downloaded archive into the subdirectory</p>
<pre>
 work/`uname -p`.d/povray-3.6.1</pre>
<p>This step also copies any other <code>DISTFILES</code> in the files directory into your
<code>work/`uname -p`.d</code> directory.  This directory can be referenced from the
Makefile as <code>$(WORKDIR)</code>.  The actual directory that Povray is extracted into
is accessible via <code>$(WORKSRC)</code>.  <code>WORKSRC</code> is constructed as:</p>
<pre>
 $(WORKDIR)/$(GARNAME)-$(GARVERSION)</pre>
<p>For povray, we do end up with the expected WORKSRC from the extraction of the
package.  Some packages do not behave as expected, with regard to how the
extract.  A situation that would require a change to WORKSRC would be a
package which extracts into a version-less directory (e.g. povray-3.6.1.tar.bz2
extracts into <code>$(WORKDIR)/PovRay</code> instead of <code>$(WORDIR)/povray-3.6.1</code>).  In
these cases, <code>WORKSRC</code> can be overridden in the Makefile.</p>
<pre>
 NOTE: It is important that any overridable variables are set before the
       'include' line for category.mk.  Any custom make rules need to be
       defined after this include line.</pre>
<p>Now that the software is extracted, change into the WORKSRC directory and
examine the package.  The package build procedure follows a well defined
order:</p>
<pre>
 configure
 build
 test
 install/package</pre>
<pre>
 NOTE: install and package are interlinked.  Running an installation
       assumes you are going to create a package, as time stamps must be
       created before any files are copied.  After the initial install/package
       is complete, it is then possible to re-run 'make package' to fine tune
       packages.  More on this later.</pre>
<p>For each of the primary stages, there is an argument variable.  To pass
arguments to the configure stage:</p>
<p>CONFIGURE_ARGS = --with-foo --without-bar</p>
<p>Passing arguments to other stages is less common, but possible with the
variables:</p>
<pre>
 BUILD_ARGS
 TEST_ARGS
 INSTALL_ARGS</pre>
<p>In general, the build system can handle most builds automatically (e.g. with
no custom code to write).  In situations where certain stages cannot be
handled by the automatic rules, use the *_SCRIPTS variables to set up custom
rule sets.  For instance, to configure using a custom 'Configure' script
provided by the package:</p>
<pre>
 CONFIGURE_SCRIPTS = custom
 
 include ../category.mk
 
 configure-custom:
     @echo &quot;Custom installation here&quot;
     @$(MAKECOOKIE)</pre>
<pre>
 NOTE: The $(MAKECOOKIE) variable is a &quot;canned command sequence&quot; which
       creates a tracking cookie in cookies/&lt;uname -p&gt;.d.  This means that
       once a target is complete, the cookie will prevent it from being
       re-run.  This enables large parallel builds from re-building dependency
       packages.</pre>
<p>For povray, we don't need to do much.  The package is well behaved, and
requires few arguments to build (the system allows for a lot of customization
for packages that don't behave well).  In order to direct povray to install
into /opt/csw instead of the default /usr/local, there are two options --
direct everything to a pre-determined prefix, or direct individual directories
to where they belong in /opt/csw.  The former is suitable for packages which
need to be installed all into one directory.  BerkeleyDB is a good example,
which would take a configuration argument like:</p>
<pre>
 CONFIGURE_ARGS = --prefix=$(prefix)</pre>
<p>As Blastwave embodies some directory standards which are not upheld by some
software installation routines, it is better to go with the latter for most
packages.  This involves defining the following variable in the Makefile
(which is defined in the default template):</p>
<pre>
 CONFIGURE_ARGS = $(DIRPATHS)</pre>
<p>The <code>DIRPATHS</code> variable expands to a list of configure options like
<code>--bindir</code> and <code>--libdir</code>.  The full list of directories specified is near
the top of gar.conf.mk.  Some software cannot handle all of the entries
present in DIRPATHS, and will complain or altogether fail.  In these cases,
the <code>NODIRPATHS</code> variable can be set to a list of directories <em>not</em> to
include in <code>DIRPATHS</code>.  For instance, to exclude the library and manual
directories from the <code>DIRPATHS</code> list:</p>
<pre>
 NODIRPATHS = libdir mandir</pre>
<p>This is not necessary for Povray -- in fact, the default CONFIGURE_ARGS which
come in the default template are sufficient for this package.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="build_the_software">Build the software</a></h2>
<p>Now that we've figured out how to fetch and configure the software, it's time
to clean up and try a build.  From the apps/povray directory, run <code>make
clean</code> to clean up any cookies, sources, and other files laying around in the
apps/povray directory.</p>
<p>To ensure the package will actually build, prior to starting any work on
packaging, run <code>make build</code>.  This will run through the following steps and
hooks:</p>
<pre>
 pre-everything
 pre-fetch fetch post-fetch
 pre-checksum checksum post-checksum
 pre-extract extract post-extract
 pre-patch patch post-patch
 pre-configure configure post-configure
 pre-build build post-build
 
Any of the pre- and post- steps above can be written into the package
Makefile, if required.  These can be used to perform any special fix-ups that
are required.  Povray, along with the vast majority of software, requires none
of these hooks in order to build.</pre>
<p>The <code>build</code> step will change directory into <code>$(WORKDIR)</code> and run <code>make</code>
with the standard build environment.  Variables available to each stage are
listed near the bottom of gar.conf.mk, in the <code>STAGE_EXPORTS</code> variable.
These will be set in the environment for the target Makefile (e.g. the
Makefile distributed with Povray).</p>
<p>If the build succeeds, it is time to install and package the software.  If the
build fails for some reason, the build can be re-run as many times as
necessary to get it to pass.  If changes to the package are required, patches
can be created.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="creating_patches">Creating Patches</a></h2>
<p>Creating custom patches within the system is easy.  First, clean up the
directory by running <code>make clean</code>.  Ensure any changes you might have made
are recorded somewhere before running this step.  Then, run <code>make extract</code> to
extract a fresh set of sources to the work directory.  Make any necessary
modifications in this directory, but beware that running any scripts (like
configure, or aclocal) that create files that were not present in the source
package will result in large patches, possibly containing generated
information which should not be in the patch.</p>
<p>When all necessary changes are committed to the working source, run <code>make
makepatch</code> from the package top directory.  This will extract a fresh version
of the source, and run a recursive diff between the two directories.  When
this is complete, a new file <code>gar-base.diff</code> will be present in the
<code>$(WORKDIR)</code>.  Move this file into <code>files</code>, rename the patch to represent
what it does (e.g. install-fix.diff), and add the patch name to the
<code>PATCHFILES</code> list in the Makefile.  Then, re-run <code>make makesum</code> to update
the checksums file for your new patch.</p>
<pre>
 NOTE: The system is supposed to be able to move the patch from $(WORKDIR)
       to the files directory automatically.  Due to a bug in one of the
       GNU utilities, the last step of make patch will error.  This does
       not affect the content of the patch at all.</pre>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="creating_the_spec">Creating the Spec</a></h2>
<p>Creating a .gspec file for your package is easy.  These are simple
configuration files with few variables.  Specs have a built-in include system,
which allows common information to be set in global files, with specific
information within a package spec overriding variables it needs to change.</p>
<p>Full documentation for .gspec files is available in the <code>mkpackage</code> script,
present in the csw/bin subdirectory.  Just run <code>mkpackage --manual</code> to get a
paginated man page, or run perldoc to get other formats (including HTML).</p>
<p>The default .gspec file included in the template files directory contains the
following:</p>
<pre>
 %var       bitname package
 %var       pkgname CSWpackage
 %include   url <a href="file://%">file://%</a>{GARDIR}/pkglib/csw_dyndepend.gspec
 %copyright url <a href="file://%">file://%</a>{WORKSRC}/LICENSE</pre>
<p>Each <em>directive</em> starts with a <code>%</code> character.  The <code>bitname</code> is the name to
be given to the Blastwave package (also known as the <code>software name</code>).  The
<code>pkgname</code> is the name of the package (the pkginfo <code>PKG</code> field).  The
<code>%include</code> line pulls in a gspec which defines commands for creating packages
with dynamic dependencies.  This will scan all binaries in the installation
directory and determine which packages provide these dependencies.  This will
build the prototype and the depend file automatically.  The final
<code>%copyright</code> line provides a URL to what will be the package copyright
notice.  In the case the copyright is embedded in a larger file, such as a
Makefile or a README document, the copyright can be specified in-line as:</p>
<pre>
 %copyright
 Copyright 2005 Some Person, Inc.
 All rights reserved.</pre>
<p>For POVray, the .gspec file would be renamed CSWpovray.gspec, and would
contain the following lines:</p>
<pre>
 %var       bitname povray
 %var       pkgname CSWpovray
 %include   url <a href="file://%">file://%</a>{GARDIR}/pkglib/csw_dyndepend.gspec
 %copyright url <a href="file://%">file://%</a>{WORKSRC}/COPYING</pre>
<p>Once these changes are complete, update the Makefile with the new .gspec name,
and re-run <code>make makesum</code> to update the checksums file.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="building_the_package">Building the Package</a></h2>
<p>Once everything is set up, including the Makefile, patches, and spec file, it
is time to build the package.  This is done by issuing the <code>make install</code>
command.  Running this when the package is already built runs the following
steps and hooks:</p>
<pre>
 pre-test test post-test
 pre-package-timestamp
 pre-install install post-install
 pre-package package post-package</pre>
<p>Of the above pre/post steps, pre-package-timestamp is the only target that
cannot be overridden.  It creates a cookie for you immediately before
installing the software that is used to create the prototype.  Any files newer
than the time stamp in the destination directory will be included in the
prototype.  All other pre/post hooks are available for override.</p>
<p>The test steps are controlled by two main variables.  When <code>make test</code> is
invoked, the system will run <code>make test</code> within the <code>WORKSRC</code> directory.  In
the event the test target is called something other than <em>test</em>, use the
<code>TEST_TARGET</code> variable to set the real target name.  For instance, most GNU
software uses a <code>check</code> target instead, so the following would cause <code>make
test</code> from the package directory to invoke <code>make check</code> in the <code>WORKSRC</code>:</p>
<pre>
 TEST_TARGET = check</pre>
<p>In some cases, there is no test target available.  A large proportion of test
software will have a test rule, but it may be empty.  Some packages do not
include a test rule at all, so invoking <code>make test</code> will cause a build
failure.  In these cases, or in cases where tests are very time-consuming or
require external support (e.g. running servers, network access), the tests can
be disabled altogether by setting:</p>
<pre>
 ENABLE_TEST = 0</pre>
<p>This will skip the pre-test, test, and post-test targets for this package.</p>
<p>Once the test targets have executed, the system will create the time stamp, and
begin installing into a fake root directory.  The top level variable
<code>DESTDIR</code> is set by the build system to support software which uses it.  Some
packages require a small patch to get them to honor <code>DESTDIR</code>.  This can be
done by using the <code>makepatch</code> target described above.  By default, <code>DESTDIR</code>
is set to /tmp/a.  This can be overridden in the <code>~/.garrc</code>.  Ensure that
this directory is cleaned up before starting the install process, if need be.</p>
<p>To install and create packages, run <code>make install</code>.  This will run the
install target in <code>WORKSRC</code> using the <code>INSTALL_ENV</code> and <code>INSTALL_ARGS</code>, if
any, provided by the package Makefile.  Immediately before installing the
files, the build system will create the time stamp cookie.  The gspec files
which are included from <code>pkglib</code> in the root directory of the build system
use this cookie to locate files which were changed since the cookie was
created (ctime).  The files are then installed to the <code>DESTDIR</code>.</p>
<p>When all files are installed, the package targets run.  The main package
target, defined in the gar.pkg.mk make module, invokes <code>mkpackage</code> to process
any .gspec files present in the <code>$(WORKDIR)</code>.  It is possible to provide more
than one .gspec for a particular software package, in order to build more than
one package out of the same source tree.  In this case, it is necessary to
include custom prototype files for the process, one per package.  See the
server/apache2 build configuration for a good example of how this is done.</p>
<p>The .gspec files are processed as mini-scripts -- each admin file has a
separate directive (e.g. <code>%prototype</code>, <code>%pkginfo</code>, ...).  Each directive can
reference a file, URL, or executable.  When an executable is specified, the
command can be a pipeline, which allows information to be transformed using
purpose built scripts.</p>
<p>A couple of key utilities to create package admin files are used by the build
system.  For instance, the <code>cswproto</code> script in csw/bin is used to create
prototypes, using the install cookie as a reference time, and a list of paths
included in CSWcommon.  The resulting prototype will fit the basic
requirements for Blastwave package installation.</p>
<p>The <code>mkpackage</code> script will create the package, transfer it, name it
according to Blastwave standards, compress it, and move it into the
SPKG_EXPORT directory defined in <code>~/.garrc</code>.  It then cleans up the spool
directory, to ensure that the package can be re-created without any errors
from pkgmk.</p>
<p>If the package was not created successfully, the <code>package</code> cookie will not be
created, so running <code>make package</code> after the installation completes will
attempt the packaging.  Any package admin files generated since the first run
will not be re-generated.  These can be removed from the work directory
manually to force <code>mkpackage</code> to regenerate them.</p>
<p>If the package was created successfully, but did not contain the correct
information, the package cookie needs to be removed before running <code>make
package</code> again.  Be sure to pick the cookie appropriate to your current
system.</p>
<p>It is sometimes appropriate to take files which <code>mkpackage</code> generates, and
move them into the files directory, and add them to the <code>DISTFILES</code> list.
The example given above, storing prototypes for splitting a single
installation into multiple packages, is one common example.  Another is
storing dynamically generated <code>depend</code> files.  Any admin file which exists
will override any rules in the .gspec which would build that file.  Making the
depend file part of the DISTFILES will eliminate the need for probing dynamic
dependencies every time the package is built.</p>

<h2><a name="clean_up">Clean Up</a></h2>
<p>Now that the build is working, and packages can be successfully built, the
directory can be cleaned up and checked into version control.  First, run the
<code>make clean</code> target.  This will delete any working files, as well as any
cookies.</p>
<p>Next, clean up any .svn working copy directories that might be in your
copied template directory.  This is easily done:</p>
<pre>
 $ cd apps/povray
 $ find . -type d -name .svn -exec rm -r {} \;</pre>
<p>Finally, add and commit the new source into version control:</p>
<pre>
 $ cd apps/povray
 $ svn add `pwd`
 $ svn commit -m &quot;adding povray 3.6.1&quot;</pre>
