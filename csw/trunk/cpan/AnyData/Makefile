DESCRIPTION = easy access to data in many formats
define BLURB
  The rather wacky idea behind this module and its sister module DBD::AnyData
  is that any data, regardless of source or format should be accessable and
  modifiable with the same simple set of methods. This module provides a
  multi-dimensional tied hash interface to data in a dozen different formats.
  The DBD::AnyData module adds a DBI/SQL interface for those same formats.
