DESCRIPTION = expand template text with embedded Perl
define BLURB
  This is a library for generating form letters, building HTML pages, or
  filling in templates generally. A `template' is a piece of text that has
  little Perl programs embedded in it here and there. When you `fill in' a
  template, you evaluate the little programs and replace them with their
  values.
