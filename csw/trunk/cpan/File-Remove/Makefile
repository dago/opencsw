DESCRIPTION = remove files and directories
define BLURB
  File::Remove::remove removes files and directories. It acts like /bin/rm,
  for the most part. Although unlink can be given a list of files, it will not
  remove directories; this module remedies that. It also accepts wildcards, *
  and ?, as arguments for filenames.
