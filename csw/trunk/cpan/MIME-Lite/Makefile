DESCRIPTION = low-calorie MIME generator
define BLURB
  MIME::Lite is intended as a simple, standalone module for generating (not
  parsing!) MIME messages... specifically, it allows you to output a simple,
  decent single- or multi-part message with text or binary attachments. It
  does not require that you have the Mail:: or MIME:: modules installed.

# Test seems to work, but wierd test harness makes it difficult
# to tell why the test fails.  Disable for now.
