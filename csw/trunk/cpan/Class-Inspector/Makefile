DESCRIPTION = provides information about classes
define BLURB
  Class::Inspector allows you to get information about a loaded class. Most or
  all of this information can be found in other ways, but they arn't always
  very friendly, and usually involve a relatively high level of Perl wizardry,
  or strange or unusual looking code. Class::Inspector attempts to provide an
  easier, more friendly interface to this information.
