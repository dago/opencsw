DESCRIPTION = base class for writing DBI drivers for plain files
define BLURB
  The DBD::File module is not a true DBI driver, but an abstract base class
  for deriving concrete DBI drivers from it. The implication is, that these
  drivers work with plain files, for example CSV files or INI files. The
  module is based on the SQL::Statement module, a simple SQL engine.
