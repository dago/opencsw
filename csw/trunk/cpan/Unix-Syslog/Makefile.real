DESCRIPTION = Perl interface to the UNIX syslog(3) calls
define BLURB
  This module provides an interface to the system logger syslogd(8) via Perl's
  XSUBs. The implementation attempts to resemble the native libc-functions of
  your system, so that anyone being familiar with syslog.h should be able to
  use this module right away.
