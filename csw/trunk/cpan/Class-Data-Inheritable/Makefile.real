DESCRIPTION = inheritable, overridable class data
define BLURB
  Class::Data::Inheritable is for creating accessor/mutators to class data.
  That is, if you want to store something about your class as a whole (instead
  of about a single object). This data is then inherited by your subclasses
  and can be overriden.
