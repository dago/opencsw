DESCRIPTION = encrypt data with cipher block chaining mode
define BLURB
  This module is a Perl-only implementation of the cryptographic cipher block
  chaining mode (CBC). In combination with a block cipher such as DES or IDEA,
  you can encrypt and decrypt messages of arbitrarily long length. The
  encrypted messages are compatible with the encryption format used by SSLeay.
