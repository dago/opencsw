DESCRIPTION = portable multitasking and networking framework for Perl
define BLURB
  POE is a framework for cooperative, event driven multitasking in Perl. Other
  languages have similar frameworks. Python has Twisted. TCL has "the event
  loop".

  POE originally was developed as the core of a persistent object server and
  runtime environment. It has evolved into a general purpose multitasking and
  networking framework, encompassing and providing a consistent interface to
  other event loops such as Event and the Tk and Gtk toolkits.
