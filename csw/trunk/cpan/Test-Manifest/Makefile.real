DESCRIPTION = interact with a t/test_manifest file
define BLURB
  MakeMaker assumes that you want to run all of the .t files in the t/
  directory in ascii-betical order during make test unless you say otherwise.
  This leads to some interesting naming schemes for test files to get them in
  the desired order.
