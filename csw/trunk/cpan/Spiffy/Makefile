DESCRIPTION = Spiffy Perl Interface Framework For You
define BLURB
  "Spiffy" is a framework and methodology for doing object oriented (OO)
  programming in Perl. Spiffy combines the best parts of Exporter.pm, base.pm,
  mixin.pm and SUPER.pm into one magic foundation class. It attempts to fix
  all the nits and warts of traditional Perl OO, in a clean, straightforward
  and (perhaps someday) standard way.
