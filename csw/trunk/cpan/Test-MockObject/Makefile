DESCRIPTION = extension for emulating troublesome interfaces
define BLURB
  It's a simple program that doesn't use any other modules, and those are easy
  to test. More often, testing a program completely means faking up input to
  another module, trying to coax the right output from something you're not
  supposed to be testing anyway.
