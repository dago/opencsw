DESCRIPTION = pretty printing of data structures
define BLURB
  This module provides a single function called dump() that takes a list of
  values as its argument and produces a string as its result. The string
  contains Perl code that, when evaled, produces a deep copy of the original
  arguments. The string is formatted for easy reading.
