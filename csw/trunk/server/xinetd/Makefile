DESCRIPTION = Powerful inetd replacement
define BLURB
  xinetd is a replacement for inetd, the internet services daemon. Anybody can
  use it to start servers that don't require privileged ports because xinetd
  does not require that the services in its configuration file be listed in
  /etc/services. It can do access control on all services based on the address
  of the remote host, time of access, connection attempts, or process limits.
