DESCRIPTION = A system performance monitoring tool
define BLURB
  Orca is a tool useful for plotting arbitrary data from text files onto
  a directory on a Web server.  It has the following features:

    * Creates an HTML tree of HTML and image (PNG or GIF) files.
    * Creates an index of URL links listing all available targets.
    * Creates an index of URL links listing all different plot types.
    * No separate CGI set up required.
    * Can be run under cron or it can sleep itself waiting for file updates
      based on when the file was last updated.
    * Configuration file based.
    * Reads arbitrarily formatted text or binary data files.
    * Watches data files for updates and sleeps between reads.
    * Finds new files at specified times.
    * Remembers the last modification times for files so they do not have to
      be reread continuously.
    * Allows arbitrary grouping of data from different files into the same
      or different plots.
    * Allows arbitrary math performed on data read from one file.
