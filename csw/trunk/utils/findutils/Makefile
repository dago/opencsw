DESCRIPTION = Find utilities
define BLURB
    The findutils package consists of three programs. `find' is a program which
    searches a directory tree to find a file or group of files. It walks the
    directory tree and reports all occurences of a file matching the user's
    specifications. `locate' scans one or more databases of filenames and displays
    any matches. `xargs' builds and executes command lines by gathering together
    arguments it reads on the standard input. Most often, these arguments are lists
    of file names generated by `find'.
