  Flex is a tool for generating programs that recognize lexical patterns in
  text.  There are many applications for Flex, including writing compilers in
  conjunction with GNU Bison. Flex is a free implementation of the well known
  Lex program. It features a Lex compatibility mode, and also provides several
  new features such as exclusive start conditions.
