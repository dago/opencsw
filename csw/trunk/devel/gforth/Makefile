DESCRIPTION = gforth - a fast and portable implementation of the ANS Forth language
define BLURB
  Gforth is a fast and portable implementation of the ANS Forth language.
  It works nicely with the Emacs editor, offers some nice features such as
  input completion and history and a powerful locals facility, and it even
  has (the beginnings of) a manual. Gforth employs traditional implementation
  techniques: its inner interpreter is indirect or direct threaded.
